hyphothesis that only friends and the simpsons have enough data to calculate meaningful heuristics,
but will proceed with full dataset. 

Bart and Lisa fall on the expected ends of the Simpson's D spectrum, but it it has a such a small range of values. Yule's K looks more meaningful but why do Lisa and Bart then rank so similarly on it?

Need to peer under the covers of how the heuristics are working. Might be calculating wrong, or tokenization might not work perfectly without more preprocessing. Moving on for now.
