[00:30, EXT. THE VILLAGE - DAY]

GWEN
When does it open?

MR BATES
Tomorrow afternoon.

GWEN
Well, let’s get up a party in the evening, if Mrs Hughes lets us, after we’ve had our dinner.

ANNA
You’re right. It doesn’t come often and it doesn’t stay long.

GWEN
Well, what about you, Mr Bates?

MR BATES
I don’t see why not.

ANNA
Well, there’s Lady Mary. You go on ahead. I’ll see you back at the house.

GWEN
Right you are, then.

ANNA
Good day, milady. Is Her Ladyship all right? Has she recovered from...?

LADY MARY
If you think she’ll ever recover from carrying the body of Mr Pamuk from one side of the house to the other, then you don’t know her at all.

ANNA
Well, I didn’t mean recover, exactly, just...get past it.

LADY MARY
She won’t do that either. When she dies, they’ll cut her open and find it engraved on her heart.

ANNA
What about you? What about your heart?

LADY MARY
Haven’t you heard? I don’t have a heart. Everyone knows that.

ANNA
Not me, milady.

[01:48, INT. LIBRARY - DAY]

MR CARSON
You wanted to see the new chauffeur, my lord.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Yes, indeed. Please send him in. Come in, come in. Good to see you again. Branson, isn’t it?

BRANSON
That’s right, Your Lordship.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I hope they’ve shown you where everything is and we’ve delivered whatever we promised at the interview.

BRANSON
Certainly, milord.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Won’t you miss Ireland ?

BRANSON
Ireland, yes, but not the job. The mistress was a nice lady, but she only had one car and she wouldn’t let me drive it over twenty miles an hour, so it was a bit…well, boring, so to speak.

[Robert chuckles.]

BRANSON
You’ve got a wonderful library.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You are very welcome to borrow books if you wish.

BRANSON
Really, milord ?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Well, there’s a ledger over there that I make everyone use, even my daughters. Carson and Mrs Hughes sometimes take a novel or two. What are your interests?

BRANSON
History and politics mainly.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Heavens. Carson, Branson is going to borrow some books. He has my permission.

MR CARSON
Very good, my lord.

BRANSON
Is that all, milord?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
It is. Off you go and good luck.

[Branson exits.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
He seems a bright spark after poor old Taylor. And to think Taylor’s gone off to run a tea shop. I cannot feel it will make for a very restful retirement, can you?

MR CARSON
I would rather be put to death, my lord.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Quite so. Thank you, Carson.

--
[03:21, EXT. DOWNTON ABBEY, GROUNDS - DAY]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
How about some house parties?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
She’s been asked to one next month by Lady Ann McNair.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
That’s a terrible idea. She doesn’t know anyone under a hundred.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I might send her over to visit my aunt. She could get to know New York.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Oh, I don’t think things are quite that desperate. Poor Mary, she’s been terribly down in the mouth lately.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
She was very upset by the death of poor Mr Pamuk.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Why? If she didn’t know him, one can’t go to pieces at the death of every foreigner. We’d all be in a state of collapse whenever we opened a newspaper. Oh, no, of course Mary’s main difficulty is that her situation is unresolved. I mean, is she an heiress or isn’t she?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
The entail’s unbreakable. Mary cannot inherit.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
No, what we need is a lawyer who’s decent and honour bound to look into it. And I…I think, perhaps, I know just the man.

[04:18, INT. CRAWLEY HOUSE - DAY]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
You going to the fair while it’s here.

MR MOLESLEY
I shouldn’t think so, sir. But I don’t mind it. I like the music.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Goodness, what’s happened to your hands?

MR MOLESLEY
It’s nothing, ma’am.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
They look very painful.

MR MOLESLEY
Oh, no, ma’am. Irritating more than painful.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Have you been using anything new to polish the silver or the shoes?

MR MOLESLEY
No.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
May I?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Leave him alone, Mother.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
It looks like erysipelas. You must have cut yourself.

MR MOLESLEY
Not that I’m aware of.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
We’ll walk ‘round to the hospital tomorrow.

MR MOLESLEY
Really, ma’am—

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
I insist.

--
[04:57, INT. KITCHENS - DAY]

ANNA
Ugh.

MRS PATMORE
You’ve got a cold, I want you out of here.

MRS HUGHES
Anna, there you are. You know I’m out tonight, because I don’t want to come home to any surprises.

MRS PATMORE (laughs)
That’ll be the day.

ANNA
We thought we might go to the fair later. You’d like that, wouldn’t you, Daisy?

MRS PATMORE
You ought to go. She’s been that down in the mouth since the death of poor Mr Pamuk.

DAISY
Don’t say that.

MRS PATMORE
She has.

ANNA
We could all walk down together after the service dinner if that’s okay.

[Anna sneezes.]

MRS PATMORE
You won’t be walking anywhere. She’s got minutes to live by the sound of it.

MRS HUGHES
Go to bed at once.

ANNA
Yes, Mrs Hughes.

MRS HUGHES
I’ll bring up a Beecham’s powder. Right, if there’s anything you want to ask me, it’ll need to be before I go.

MRS PATMORE
What would I want to ask you? I’m preparing a meal for Lord and Lady Grantham and the girls. No one is visiting. No one is staying.

MRS HUGHES
Well…that’s settled, then.

--
[05:59, INT. DOWNTON COTTAGE HOSPITAL - DAY]

NURSE
I’m afraid Dr Clarkson’s out delivering a baby. We don’t know when he’ll be back.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
No matter. If you’ll just open the store cupboard, I can easily find what I need.

NURSE
Well, I—

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
You can tell the doctor that opened the cupboard for the chairman of the board. I assure you, he will raise not the slightest objection. This should do it. Tincture of steel, ten drops in water three times a day. And this is solution of nitrate of silver, rub a little in morning and night.

MR MOLESLEY
How long before it’s better?

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Erysipelas is very hard to cure. We should be able to reduce the symptoms, but that might be all we can manage. Oh, and you must wear gloves at all times.

MR MOLESLEY
I couldn’t…wait a table in gloves. I’d look like a footman.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
You may have to. The tincture and the salve will help. Try it for a week and we’ll see.

--
[06:49, INT. HAVEL AND CARTER - DAY]

ATTORNEY ASSISTANT
Someone to see you, Mr Crawley.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Well, there’s nothing in my diary.

ATTORNEY ASSISTANT
It’s Lady Grantham.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Well, in that case, show her in at once. Cousin Cora, to what do I owe the…

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Oh, I hope I’m not a disappointment.

--
[07:09, INT. MRS HUGHES'S SITTING ROOM - DAY]
[Mrs Hughes looks at a hat.]

MRS HUGHES
I thought it might be nice to cheer it up a bit.

MISS O’BRIEN
Easier said than done.

MRS HUGHES
Perhaps with a flower or a bit of veil or something.

MISS O’BRIEN
I can find you a veil if you like. I hope you’re not expecting me to do it.

MRS HUGHES
Not if you’re busy, of course.

MISS O’BRIEN
Good.

MRS HUGHES
And Miss O’Brien, I’ve sent Anna to bed with a cold, so I need you to manage the young ladies.

MISS O’BRIEN
What, all three of them? I’m not an octopus. Why can’t Gwen do it?

MRS HUGHES
Because she is not a lady’s maid.

MISS O’BRIEN
I am not a slave.

MRS HUGHES
Just do it, Miss O’Brien. Just do it.

--
[07:47, INT. HAVEL AND CARTER - DAY]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I’ll pay you the compliment that I do not believe you wish to inherit just because nobody’s investigated properly.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
No, but—

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Nor can Murray accuse you of making trouble when you’re the one who will suffer most from a discovery.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
You’re right that I don’t wish to benefit at Mary’s expense from an ignorance of the law--

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Putting it bluntly, do you think Robert has thrown in the towel prematurely?

[Violet’s chair creaks.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Good heavens, what am I sitting on?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
A swivel chair.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Oh, another modern brainwave?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Not very modern. They were invented by Thomas Jefferson.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Why does every day involve a fight with an American?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I’ll fetch a different one.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
No, no. No, no, I’m a good sailor.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
It will depend on the exact terms of the entail and of the deed of gift when Cousin Cora’s money was transferred to the estate.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
That is all I ask. To understand the exact terms.

[BREAK 1]

ACT TWO
[08:48, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - DAY]

WILLIAM
Is Daisy going to the fair tonight with the others?

MR BATES
Why don’t you ask her? She needs taking out of herself. What’s it to you?

THOMAS
Nothing.

WILLIAM
Daisy, I was hoping that—

THOMAS
Would you like to go to the fair with me, Daisy? There’s a few of us going later on.

DAISY
Do you mean it?

MRS PATMORE
Daisy, don’t let it get cold. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!

MR BATES
You bastard.

--
[09:32, EXT. THE VILLAGE - DAY]
[Sybil, Edith, and Cora walk towards the car where Branson is waiting.]

LADY EDITH
Why is Sybil having a new dress and not me?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Because it’s Sybil’s turn.

LADY SYBIL
Can it be my choice this time?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Of course, darling. As long as you choose what I choose. Branson, you’ll be taking Lady Sybil to Ripon tomorrow. She’ll be leaving after luncheon.

BRANSON
Certainly, Your Ladyship.

LADY SYBIL
Poor old Madame Swann. I don’t know why we bother with fittings. She always makes the same frock.

LADY EDITH
What do you want her to make?

LADY SYBIL
Something new and exciting.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Heavens, look at the time. Not a minute to change. And Granny’s invited herself for dinner.

LADY SYBIL
Then she can jolly well wait.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
So, women’s rights begin at home, I see. Well, I’m all for that.

[The ladies chuckle and Branson drives off.]

--
[10:19, INT. MR CARSON'S OFFICE - DAY]

MRS HUGHES
I’m just off, Mr Carson.

MR CARSON
According to the wine book, we should still have six dozen of this, but I’m beggared if I can find much more than four.

MRS HUGHES
Look again before you jump to any nasty conclusions.

MR CARSON
Long time since you last took a night off.

MRS HUGHES
You don’t think I ought to stay, do you?

MR CARSON
Certainly not. Be off with you.

MRS HUGHES
And Anna’s in bed with a cold, so I’m afraid it’s all down to you.

MR CARSON
Go.

--
[10:51, EXT. THE VILLAGE FAIR - EVENING]
[Matthew plays the Coconut Saloon game at the fair. Mary sees him and approaches.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I wanted to have a go before I went home. How about you?

[Matthew digs in his pockets for more change.]

FAIR VENDOR
Thank you.

[The vendor hands Mary and Matthew some more balls to throw.]

LADY MARY
Thank you.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Do you know if your father’s doing anything this evening?

LADY MARY
He’s not coming to the fair.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Seriously.

LADY MARY
Well, having dinner with his family.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Could I look in afterwards?

LADY MARY
May I ask why?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Your grandmother paid me a visit this afternoon and I’m…well, never mind, but I—I would like to see him.

LADY MARY
Granny came to see you. Is it all part of The Great Matter? So, are you enjoying your new life?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Yes, I think so. I know my work seems very trivial to you.

LADY MARY
Not necessarily. Sometimes I rather envy you, having somewhere to go every morning.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I thought that made me very middle class?

LADY MARY
You should learn to forget what I say. I know I do.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
How about you? Is your life proving satisfactory, apart from the Great Matter, of course?

LADY MARY
Women like me don’t have a life. We choose clothes and pay calls and work for charity and do the season, but really, we’re stuck in a waiting room until we marry.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I’ve made you angry.

LADY MARY
My life makes me angry, not you.

--
[12:33, INT. ]

MR CARSON
I never put the Sauterne on ice. Mrs Hughes goes out for one night and we all fall to pieces!

THOMAS
Mr Carson, we wondered if we could walk down to the fair after dinner.

MR CARSON
I suppose so, but don’t be too late.

MRS PATMORE
…that’s right.

THOMAS
Where do you think she’s gone?

WILLIAM
None of your business.

MRS PATMORE
Like most of what goes on ‘round here.

DAISY
Oh!

THOMAS
Well caught, that man, though I say it myself.

DAISY
Thanks ever so. Yes?

MRS PATMORE
Well, you’ve cheered up a bit.

DAISY
He’s so agile, i’in’t he? He could have been a sportsman.

MRS PATMORE
Who?

DAISY
Thomas, of course.

MRS PATMORE
Really? Which sport did you have in mind?

--
[13:19, INT. GRAND STAIRCASE - EVENING]

LADY MARY
I ran into Cousin Matthew in the village. He wanted to call on you after dinner. Apparently, Granny’s been to see him.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Did you tell him she’s coming here this evening?

LADY MARY
Well, I didn’t know she was.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
When he arrives, do your best to keep her in the drawing room.

LADY MARY
Well, I’d like to see you try.

[Robert chuckles.]

--
[13:39, INT. OUTER HALL - EVENING]
[Matthew enters the house as the ladies are walking from the dining room to the drawing room.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Don’t stay too late. Let them have an early night.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Sybil, Sybil, darling, why would you want to go to real school? You’re not a doctor’s daughter.

LADY SYBIL
But nobody learns anything from a governess apart from French and how to curtsy.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Well, what else do you need?

LADY SYBIL
Well, there’s—

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Are you thinking of a career in banking?

[Mary turns around and sees Matthew through the glass door. She holds up a hand to wait until the others have gone into the next room.]

LADY SYBIL
No, but it is a noble profession.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Things are different in America.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I know. They live in wigwams.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
And when they come out of them, they go to school.

[Mary goes to the door and opens it to speak to Matthew.]

LADY MARY (whisper)
If you wait in the library, I’ll tell Papa you’re here.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Thank you.

[William watches the exchange.]

--
[14:46, EXT. THE VILLAGE FAIR - EVENING]

JOE BURNS
Elsie? It is Elsie, isn’t it?

MRS HUGHES
It is. Though, there’s very few left to call me that, Joe Burns.

JOE BURNS
Well, I’m flattered that I’m one of them.

--
[15:18, INT. LIBRARY - EVENING]
[Carson brings in the port.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Where’s Thomas?

MR CARSON
I’m afraid I let some of the servants go down to the fair, my lord. I didn’t know we’d have any visitors tonight.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Well, that’s all right. They don’t have much fun. You should join them. So, what did you say to Mama?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I haven’t spoken to her since her visit, but I have looked through every source and I can’t find one reason on which to base a challenge.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I could have told you that.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I’m not quite sure how to phrase it when I tell her.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
She shouldn’t have put you on the spot like that. It was unkind.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I’m afraid she’ll think I’ve failed because I don’t want to succeed.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
She will think that, but I don’t. And nor will Cora.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Of course it’s impossible for Mary. She must resent me so bitterly. And I don’t blame her.

--
[16:09, INT. THE GRANTHAM ARMS - EVENING]
[Mrs Hughes and Joe burns sit at a table having dinner.]

MRS HUGHES
Yes, it must have been hard for you when Ivy died.

JOE BURNS
Took some getting used to.

MRS HUGHES
What about your son? Do you see much of him?

JOE BURNS
Peter? No. I would’ve given him a share of the farm if he wanted it, but he’s joined the army.

MRS HUGHES
Well, I never.

JOE BURNS
Oh, he seems happy, but he’s left me on me own.

[WHO]
…take your plate, then.

JOE BURNS
Thank you. So, how’s life treated you?

MRS HUGHES
Oh, I can’t complain. I haven’t travelled, but I’ve seen a bit of life and no mistake.

JOE BURNS
I notice you call yourself Misses.

MRS HUGHES
Housekeepers and cooks are always Misses. You know better than anyone I haven’t changed my name.

JOE BURNS
Well, I know you wouldn’t change it to Burns when you had the chance.

--
[17:03, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - EVENING]

MISS O’BRIEN
You shouldn’t have eaten with us. The chauffeur always eats in his own cottage.

MR BATES
Steady on. You can cut him a bit of slack on his second day.

BRANSON
I’m waiting to take old Lady Grantham home.

MISS O’BRIEN
Even then, Taylor never ate with us. You’re taking advantage of Mrs Hughes’s absence.

BRANSON
What are you doing?

MR BATES
I’m sorting the collars, removing the ones that have come to an end.

BRANSON
What happens to His Lordship’s old clothes?

MISS O’BRIEN
What’s it to you? Clothes are a valet’s pert, not a chauffeur's.

MR BATES
I get some, but most of it goes into the missionary barrel.

BRANSON
I know it’s meant to be kind, but I can think of better ways of helping the needy than sending stiff collars to the equator.

[Bates chuckles.]

MR BATES
I thought Anna might have come down for her dinner.

MISS O’BRIEN
And show she’s ready to start work again? Not a chance.

MR BATES
She’s still in bed, then?

MISS O’BRIEN
She is. While I’m sat here sewing like a cursed princess in a fairytale and not down at the fair with the others.

--
[18:00, INT. DRAWING ROOM - EVENING]

MR CARSON
Would you like me to ask Branson to bring the car around, my lady?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Where’s Robert? He can’t have been drinking port since we left, he’d be under the table by now.

MR CARSON
His Lordship’s in the library.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
All alone? Oh, how sad.

MR CARSON
No, he’s--

LADY MARY
We can say goodbye to Papa for you, Granny.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
He’s what?

MR CARSON
He’s with Mr Crawley, my lady.

--
[18:27, INT. LIBRARY - EVENING]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
The question is, what do I say to Cousin Violet?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Oh, don’t worry about that. I can handle her.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Really?

[Matthew stands up and Robert looks over in surprise.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Well, if you can, you must’ve learned to very recently.

[BREAK 2]

ACT THREE
[18:45, INT. SERVANTS’ BEDROOM CORRIDOR - EVENING]
[Anna reads by candle light in bed. Mr Bates knocks on the door between the men and women’s corridor. Anna goes out into the hall and approached the door.]

MR BATES
Anna.

ANNA
Mr Bates.

MR BATES
Can you open the door?

ANNA
I daren’t. No one can open that door except Mrs Hughes.

MR BATES
Just for a moment. I brought you something.

[Anna unlocks the door. Mr Bates has a dinner tray for her.]

ANNA
I don’t know what to—

MR BATES
Shh!

[Bates hands her the tray.]

--
[20:05, EXT. DOWNTON ABBEY, FRONT WALK - EVENING]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
What I don’t understand in all this is you. You seem positively glad to see Mary disinherited.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You speak as if we had a choice.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Thank you, Branson.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I’m worn out. Tell Lady Mary and Mr Crawley I’ve gone to bed.

MR CARSON
Shall I tell them now, my lord?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
No. Wait until they ring.

--
[20:37, EXT. THE VILLAGE FAIR - EVENING]

FAIRFOLK (background)
Yes, sir.

MRS HUGHES
I ought to start back. This is very late for me.

JOE BURNS
Oh, not yet. It’s a long time since I’ve had a girl to show off for at the fair.

FAIRFOLK (background)
Fair enough.

JOE BURNS
So, I take it you never get lonely?

MRS HUGHES
Well, that’s working in a big house. Though there are times you yearn for a bit of solitude.

[Joe plays the fair game.]

MRS HUGHES
Oh!

FAIR VENDOR
We have a winner!

JOE BURNS
Ah, thank you. Well, er…something to remind you of me.

MRS HUGHES (chuckles)
I don’t need help to remember you.

JOE BURNS
But what—what happens when you retire?

MRS HUGHES
I should think I’ll stay here.

JOE BURNS
Suppose they sell the estate.

MRS HUGHES
Suppose there’s a tidal wave. Suppose we all die of the plague. Suppose there’s a war.

[They chuckle.]

THOMAS
What did I tell you? She’s found her Romeo.

GWEN
That might be her brother.

THOMAS
She hasn’t got a brother, I would know it by now, just a sister in Levinson Sands.

DAISY
You know everything, don’t you?

WILLIAM (scoffs)
Everything, my foot. You’re hiding behind him, but he’s not what you think he is.

DAISY
Oh, go on, William, if you’re gonna be such a spoil sport.

WILLIAM
All right, I will.

[William marches off.]

GWEN
Oh, come back, she didn’t mean it!

MRS HUGHES
I must go, but it’s been lovely to see you again, Joe. Really.

JOE BURNS
And you know what I’m asking?

MRS HUGHES
You haven’t asked anything yet.

JOE BURNS
But you know what it is when I do. I’m gonna stop here at the pub until I hear from you. Oh, and take your time. I’d rather wait a week for the right answer than get a wrong one in a hurry. Think about it carefully.

MRS HUGHES
I will. I promise you that.

--
[22:54, INT. LIBRARY - EVENING]
[Mary rings the bell.]

LADY MARY
To break the entail, we’d need a private bill in Parliament.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Even then, it would only be passed if the estate were in danger, which it’s not.

LADY MARY
And I mean nothing in all this.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
On the contrary, you mean a great deal…very great deal.

MR CARSON
You rang, my lady?

LADY MARY
Yes, Carson. Mr Crawley was just leaving. Do you know where His Lordship is?

MR CARSON
Gone to bed, my lady. He felt tired after he put Lady Grantham into the car.

LADY MARY
I bet he did. Thank you, Carson.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I’m sorry, I wish I could think of something to say that would help.

LADY MARY
There’s nothing. But you mustn’t let it trouble you.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
It does trouble me. It troubles me very much.

LADY MARY
Then that will be my consolation prize. Goodnight, Cousin Matthew.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Goodnight.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I hope I haven’t kept you up too late. I’m afraid we’ve interfered with your dinner.

MR CARSON
It’s been rather a chop and change evening downstairs.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Lady Grantham got off all right?

MR CARSON
“All right” is an optimistic assessment, sir.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
It’s very difficult, Carson, for her, for Lady Mary, for everyone.

MR CARSON
It is Mr Crawley. But I appreciate your saying so.

--
[24:39, INT. SERVANTS' CORRIDOR/HALL - NIGHT]

MISS O’BRIEN
Well, that’s the greatness done and dusted for the night.

MR BATES
William, you had a good night?

WILLIAM
I’m off to bed.

[William gets up from the table and leaves.]

MR BATES
Wait.

[William stops at the base of the stairs.]

MR BATES
What happened?

WILLIAM
Nothing. Doesn’t matter.

[William leaves.]

MR BATES
How was your evening, Mrs Hughes?

MRS HUGHES
Very enjoyable, thank you. The others are just behind me, so you can lock up in a minute. Well, I’ll say goodnight.

MR BATES
Goodnight Misses.

MISS O’BRIEN
Night.

THOMAS
Goodnight, Mrs Hughes. I was right when I said she was looking sparkly-eyed.

MR CARSON
I beg your pardon, Thomas?

THOMAS
He can disapprove all he likes, Mrs Hughes has got a fancy man.

DAISY (snorts)
Him a fancy man?

MR BATES
Don’t be so nasty, Daisy, it doesn’t suit you.

THOMAS
I reckon there’s a job vacancy coming up. Miss O’Brien, do you fancy a promotion?

MISS O’BRIEN (scoffs)
Very droll. If she’s got a boyfriend, I’m a giraffe.

--
[26:03, INT. SERVANTS’ BEDROOM CORRIDOR - NIGHT]
[Mr Bates knocks on William’s door and opens it.]

WILLIAM
Leave me alone, Mr Bates. I know you mean well, but let me be.

[Bates closes the door.]

THOMAS
What chance did he have up against a champion?

[Bates grabs Thomas and shoves him up against the wall.]

MR BATES
Now, you listen, you filthy little rat. If you don’t lay off, I will punch your shining teeth through the back of your skull.

THOMAS
Is this supposed to frighten me, Mr Bates? ‘Cause if it is, it isn’t working. I’m sorry, but it’s just not working.

[Bates lets Thomas go roughly.]

[27:33, INT. KITCHENS - MORNING]

MRS PATMORE
Daisy? Chafing dishes, now!

DAISY
They're right in front of you, Mrs Patmore.

MRS PATMORE
Are you trying to trick me?

MRS HUGHES
Anna’s still not well. O’Brien, you’ll need to dress the girls this morning.

MISS O’BRIEN
All we know about Lady Mary and here I am waiting on her hand and foot.

THOMAS
Will we do anything with that?

MISS O’BRIEN
Maybe. But not yet.

THOMAS
What do you look like? Daisy, what do you think he looks like? Do your buttons up.

DAISY
Well, go on, then.

--
[28:42, INT. LADY SYBIL’S BEDROOM - MORNING]
[Gwen enters as O'Brien is fixing Sybil's hair.]

MISS O’BRIEN
What do you want?

GWEN
I’ve got a message for Lady Sybil from Her Ladyship.

LADY SYBIL
Thank you, O’Brien, I’ll manage now.

[O’Brien leaves.]

LADY SYBIL
Odious woman. What does Mama want?

GWEN
I just said that to get rid of her. This came today.

[Gwen hands Sybil a letter. Sybil opens and reads it.]

LADY SYBIL
I knew they would want to see you.

GWEN
Well, it’s your reference what’s done it. But how am I going to get there? They won’t let me take a day off.

LADY SYBIL
You’re going to be ill. They can’t stop you being ill.

GWEN
What?

LADY SYBIL
No one has seen Anna for a whole day. They won’t notice if you vanish for a couple of hours.

[29:33, EXT. DOWNTON ABBEY, GROUNDS - DAY]
[Mary and Robert walk with the dog.]

LADY MARY
The only one who never sticks up for me in all this is you. Why is that?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You are my darling daughter, and I love you, hard as it is for an Englishman to say the words.

LADY MARY
Well, then.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
If I had made my own fortune and bought Downton for myself, it should be yours without question. But I did not. My fortune is the work of others who laboured to build a great dynasty. Do I have the right to destroy their work or impoverish that dynasty? I am a custodian, my dear, not an owner. I must strive to be worthy of the task I’ve been set. If I could take Mama’s out of the estate, Downton would have to be sold to pay for it. Is that what you want? To see Matthew a landless peer with a title but no means to pay for it?

LADY MARY
So I’m just to find a husband and get out of the way?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You could stay here if you married Matthew.

LADY MARY
You know my character, Father. I’d never marry any man that I was told to. I’m stubborn. I wish I wasn’t, but I am.

--
[31:03, EXT. MOTOR CAR - DAY]

BRANSON
Will you have your own way, do you think? With the frock? Only, I couldn’t help overhearing yesterday, and from what Her Ladyship said, it sounded as if you support women’s rights.

LADY SYBIL
I suppose I do.

BRANSON
Because I’m quite political. In fact, I brought some pamphlets that I thought might interest you about the vote.

LADY SYBIL
Thank you. But please don’t mention this to my father, or my grandmother. One whiff of reform and she hears the rattle of the guillotine. It seems rather unlikely, a revolutionary chauffeur.

BRANSON
Maybe. But I’m a socialist, not a revolutionary. And I won’t always be a chauffeur.

[31:52, INT. DOWNTON COTTAGE HOSPITAL - DAY]

DR CLARKSON
Mrs Crawley, how nice.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
If you’re busy, we can come back later.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Molesley? What are you doing here? Are y—are you ill?

DR CLARKSON
Poor Mr Molesley. Er, how’s it going?

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
The solution doesn’t seem to make it any better.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
My imagination’s running riot.

MR MOLESLEY
I’ve got erysipelas, Your Ladyship.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Oh. Oh, I am sorry.

DR CLARKSON
Mrs Crawley tells me she’s recommended nitrate of silver and tincture of steel.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Why? Is she making a suit of armour?

DR CLARKSON
But, er, I take it there’s been no improvement.

MR MOLESLEY
Not really.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
And you’re sure it’s erysipelas?

DR CLARKSON
That is...Mrs Crawley’s diagnosis.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
What it is to have medical knowledge.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
It has its uses.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Mm. I see your father has been making changes at home.

MR MOLESLEY
He has, milady. He’s got no use for the herb garden now me mother’s gone, so he’s turned it to grass.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
And you’ve been helping him?

MR MOLESLEY
I have.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM (chuckles)
Grubbing out the old rue hedge.

MR MOLESLEY
How did you know that?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Because this is not erysipelas. This is a rue allergy. If Molesley wears gardening gloves, it’ll be gone in a week. Please, don’t think we’re ungrateful for your enthusiasm, Mrs Crawley, but there comes a time when things are best left to the professionals.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
But I—

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
And now I really—I really must go. Good day.

MR MOLESLEY
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

[Violet chuckles as she exits.]

ACT FOUR
[33:28, EXT. VILLAGE COTTAGES - DAY]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I hope Cousin Violet has recovered from last night.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Whatever she says, my mother is as strong as an ox, and it’s high time she let go of her scheme for upsetting everything. Time we all did.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I can’t deny I’m pleased to hear it.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Are you beginning to see a future here, then?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
In a way, this latest business has forced me to recognise that I do want Downton to be my future.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I’m glad.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
You must have thought me an awful prig when I first arrived.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Not a prig, just a man thrust into something he never wanted or envisaged.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I can only see the absurdity of the whole thing. I’m sorry.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Well, there are absurdities involved as I know well enough.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Possibilities, too, and I was blind to them. I was determined not to let it change me. It was absurd. If you don’t change, you die.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Do you think so? I’m not sure. Sometimes I think I hate change.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Well, at least we can comfort ourselves that this’ll still be here...because we saved it.

[34:30, INT. KITCHENS - DAY]

DAISY
Thomas is lovely in every way. He’s funny and handsome, and he’s got such lovely teeth.

MRS PATMORE
He’s not for you, Daisy.

DAISY
‘Course not. He’s too good for me, I know that.

MRS PATMORE
No. He’s not too good.

DAISY
What then?

MRS PATMORE
He’s not the boy for you, and you’re not the girl for him.

DAISY
I’in’t that what I just said? And why would he be when he’s seen and done so much and I’ve been nowhere and done nothing?

MRS PATMORE
Perhaps Thomas has seen and done more than is good for him. He’s not a lady’s man.

DAISY
But i’in’t it a blessed relief?

MRS PATMORE
Daisy, Thomas is a troubled soul.

DAISY
I don’t know what you mean, Mrs Patmore.

MRS PATMORE
Oh, nothing. I don’t mean anything. Except, if I don’t get the ice cream started, they’ll be dining at midnight.

[35:31, INT. EDITH'S BEDROOM - EVENING]

LADY SYBIL
Golly, my corset’s tight. Anna, when you’ve done that, would you be an angel and loosen it a bit?

LADY EDITH
The start of the slippery slope.

LADY SYBIL
I’m not putting on weight.

LADY EDITH
It didn’t shrink in the drawer.

[Mary enters.]

LADY MARY
Are you coming down?

LADY SYBIL
I don’t know why we bother with corsets. Men don’t wear them and they look perfectly normal in their clothes.

LADY MARY
Not all of them.

LADY EDITH
She’s just showing off. She’ll be on about the vote in a minute.

LADY SYBIL
If you mean, do I think women should have the vote, of course I do.

LADY EDITH
I hope you won’t chain yourself to the railings and end up being force fed semolina.

LADY MARY
What do you think, Anna?

ANNA
I think those women are very brave.

LADY SYBIL
Hear, hear.

--
[36:14, INT. DRAWING ROOM - EVENING]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
How did you get on with your dressmaker? Find anything?

LADY SYBIL
I did. And she says she can have it done by Friday.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I’m sorry I couldn’t come, but I didn’t want to put Matthew off.

LADY EDITH
Were you pleased with the cottages?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I think they’re making a very good job of them. You must all go and see.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
You will restore a few every year from now on?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
It was Matthew’s idea. Old Cripps was rather reluctant, but I’m pleased we went forward.

LADY EDITH
I suppose it’s worth it.

LADY SYBIL
Of course it is, because of the people who will live in them.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You’ll be glad to hear that Matthew’s conscience is much more energetic than mine.

LADY MARY
If you’ll excuse me, I’m going to bed. I’ve rather a headache.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Of course. Should I bring you something for it?

LADY MARY
No, I’ll be perfectly fine if I can just lie down.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Mary...

[Cora goes after Mary.]

--
[37:03, INT. LADY MARY'S BEDROOM - EVENING]
[Mary is sobbing.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Oh, my darling. What is it?

LADY MARY
You heard him. Matthew this. Matthew that. Matthew, Matthew, Matthew. Oh, Mother, don’t you see? He has his son now. Of course he didn’t argue with the entail. Why would he when he’s got what he always wanted?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Your father loves you very much.

LADY MARY
He wouldn’t fight for me, though.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
He wouldn’t fight for you because he knew he couldn’t win.

LADY MARY
You’re no better.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
What?

LADY MARY
You don’t care about Matthew getting everything, because you don’t think I’m worthy of it!

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Mary!

LADY MARY
I wish you’d just admit it! I’m a lost soul to you! I took a lover with no thought of marriage! A Turk! Think of that! Oh, my dear! Don’t worry, Mama. You can go down now. Everything will look better in the morning. Isn’t that what you usually say?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I say it because it’s usually true.

LADY MARY
Papa will wonder where you are.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Don’t quarrel with Matthew.

LADY MARY
Why shouldn’t I?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Because one day you may need him.

LADY MARY
Oh, I see. When I’ve ruined myself, I must have a powerful protector to hide behind.

[38:48, INT. SERVANTS’ HALL - DAY]
[William plays the piano.]

MRS HUGHES
I’d tell you off—

[William stops and quickly stands up.]

MRS HUGHES
But I like to hear you play. Where are they all?

WILLIAM
Busy, I suppose.

MRS HUGHES
Haven’t you got anything to do?

WILLIAM
Yes, I have. ‘Course I have.

MRS HUGHES
You mustn’t let Thomas get you down. He’s just jealous. Everyone likes you better than him.

WILLIAM
Not everyone.

MRS HUGHES
Then she’s a foolish girl and she doesn’t deserve you. Though, why am I encouraging you? Forget all that for ten years at least.

WILLIAM
You’re a kind woman, Mrs Hughes. I don’t know how this house would run without you. I don’t, truly.

MRS HUGHES
Stop flannelling and get on before I betray you to Mr Carson.

[William leaves. ]

[Gwen opens a letter and is disappointed by the contents.]

[40:37, INT. LADY SYBIL’S BEDROOM - DAY]
[Sybil opens a box exitedly.]

LADY SYBIL
Is there anything more thrilling than a new frock?

GWEN
I suppose not, milady.

LADY SYBIL
You shall have one, too. I thought this would be suitable for your interview.

GWEN
Well, I won’t be wearing it, milady.

LADY SYBIL
Of course you will! We have to make you look like a successful professional woman. What is it? What’s happened?

GWEN
Well, I won’t wear it because I’m not going. They’ve cancelled the appointment. They’ve found someone more suited for the post and better qualified.

LADY SYBIL
This time.

GWEN
Let’s face it. There will never be anyone less suited for the post or worse qualified than I am.

LADY SYBIL
That isn’t true. You’ll see. We’re not giving up. No one hits the bull’s eye with the first arrow.

[41:34, INT. MRS HUGHES'S SITTING ROOM - EVENING]

MR CARSON
I've put out the Rundell candlesticks for dinner tonight.

[Mrs Hughes nods absentmindedly, concentrating on her thoughts.]

MR CARSON
Ah. I’m sorry, I’ll come back later.

MRS HUGHES
No, stay, please. I’ve got something I’d like to talk to you about, if you’ve a minute.

[Mr Carson enters and closes the door and they sit opposite each other.]

MRS HUGHES
Before I first came here as head housemaid, I was walking out with a farmer. When I told him I’d taken a job at Downton, he asked me to marry him. I was a farmer’s daughter from Argyle, so I knew the life. He was very nice. But then I came here and I—I did well, and I...I didn’t want to give it up. So, I told him no, and he married someone else. She died three years ago, and last month, he wrote asking to see me again, and I agreed, because all this time, I’ve wondered.

MR CARSON
Go on.

MRS HUGHES
I met him the other night. We had dinner at the Grantham Arms and after, he took me to the fair.

MR CARSON
And he was horrible and fat and red-faced and you couldn’t think what you ever saw in him?

MRS HUGHES
He was still a nice man. He is still a nice man. Well, he was a bit red-faced, and his suit was a little tight, but none of that matters. In the real ways, he hadn’t changed.

MR CARSON
And he proposed again...and you accepted?

MRS HUGHES
In many ways, I wanted to accept. But I’m not that farm girl anymore. I was flattered, of course, but... I’ve changed, Mr Carson.

MR CARSON
Life’s altered you, as it’s altered me. And what would be the point of living if we didn’t let life change us? You won’t be leaving, then?

[Anna knocks and enters.]

ANNA
You better come. Mrs Patmore’s on the rampage. She wants the key to the store cupboard, and you know how angry she gets she hasn’t got one of her own.

MRS HUGHES
Nor will she have. Not while I’m housekeeper here. Leaving? When would I ever find the time.

MRS PATMORE
...I had to go cap in hand to Mary. It never stops!

--
[44:23, INT. DRAWING ROOM - EVENING]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Whatever is holding Sybil up?

LADY MARY
She was going on about her new frock.

--
[44:33, INT. LADY SYBIL’S BEDROOM - EVENING]
[Anna helps Sybil dress.]

--
[44:41, INT. DRAWING ROOM - EVENING]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
We’d better go in without her, or it’s not fair on Mrs Patmore.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Oh, is her cooking so precisely timed? You couldn’t tell.

--
[44:50, INT. LADY SYBIL’S BEDROOM - EVENING]
[Anna fetches Sybil's shoes.]

--
[44:53, INT. DRAWING ROOM - EVENING]

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
I think her food is delicious.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Naturally.

[45:00, INT. LADY SYBIL’S BEDROOM - EVENING]
[Sybil giggles and Anna fixes a cloth in her hair. Sybil shows off the complete look to Anna and Anna giggles.]

--
[45:12, INT. DRAWING ROOM - EVENING]
[Sybil rushes down the stairs and enters.]

LADY SYBIL
Good evening, everyone.

[Sybil shows off her new trouser frock. Everyone's jaws drop. Matthew grins. Branson peeks in through the window and smiles.]
