CORA
We can put the presents in the drawing room against the window.

MRS HUGHES
Very good, milady.

[Mrs Hughes leaves to take care of it.]

ISOBEL
I suppose we do have to display all the presents. It can look rather greedy.

LAVINIA
I can't bear the disruption we seem to have brought down on your heads.

CORA
Don't be silly.

[Matthew enters and Mary and Lavinia go to him.]

LADY MARY
How are you feeling?

MATTHEW
Just wish I could get rid of this damn stick. Sorry.

LADY MARY
Don't be. If anyone has a right to swear, it's you.

CORA
Don't bully yourself. Think of where we were a few months ago and smile.

LADY MARY
I quite agree.

MATTHEW
I want to make it up and down that isle without assistance.

LAVINIA
Up, yes. You'll have me to lean on when you're coming down.

LADY MARY
And you still have three full days of practice, so never say die.

ISOBEL
My goodness, is that the time? I must be getting back.

LAVINIA
I'll go with you.

MATTHEW
She's just sucking up, Mother.

LAVINIA
Any bride who doesn't suck up to her husband's mother is a fool.

[Isobel chuckles and they exit arm in arm. Matthew smiles after them.]

[00:01:35, INT. MR CARSON'S OFFICE - DAY]
[Mrs Hughes knocks and enters.]

MRS HUGHES
Can I bother you? Mrs Bryant has written a letter I did not expect.

[Mrs Hughes hands it to Mr Carson.]

MRS HUGHES
She says her husband wants to see the baby. They both do.

MR CARSON
Isn't that what you hoped?

MRS HUGHES
Yes and no. Remember what he was like the last time. I don't want to build up Ethel's hopes again.

MR CARSON
Ethel's not important. It's the boy's chances you have to look to.

MRS HUGHES
I believe you're right, though we come at it by different routes.

--
[00:02:09, INT. LADY MARY'S BEDROOM - EVENING]

LADY MARY
But why announce it tonight all of a sudden?

LADY SYBIL
He's got a job at a newspaper. He heard today it's a real chance.

LADY MARY
Let him go to Dublin and then you can use the calm to consider.

[Sybil scoffs.]

LADY EDITH
Mary doesn't want you to be trapped before you're completely sure.

LADY SYBIL
But I am sure! How many times do I have to say it? Anna, tell them.

ANNA
Lady Mary's right. It's a very big thing to give up your whole world.

LADY MARY
Thank you. Listen to her if you won't listen to me.

LADY SYBIL
But I'm not giving up my world! They want to give me up. That's their affair. I'm perfectly happy to carry on being friends with everyone.

LADY MARY
Married to the chauffeur?

LADY SYBIL
Yes. Anyway, he's a journalist now, which sounds better for Granny.

[Sybil sits down on the bed, frustrated.]

LADY SYBIL
We're going to tell Papa tonight.

[They all stare at her.]

LADY EDITH
"We"? You mean, you and Branson?

LADY SYBIL
He's coming in after dinner.

LADY EDITH
But what will Papa do?

LADY MARY
I imagine he'll call the police.

[Sybil sniffs and shakes her head.]

--
[00:03:11, INT. MR CARSON'S OFFICE - EVENING]

MR CARSON
Downton is not a hostel.

THOMAS
No, Mr Carson.

MR CARSON
And you made such a point of not being a servant anymore, our ears are ringing with it.

THOMAS
The trouble is, I'm a little out of pocket at the moment.

MR CARSON
I cannot say that I 'm sympathetic, when you dabble in the black market.

THOMAS
I just need some more time, Mr Carson.

MR CARSON
How long is it since the last patient left, Sergeant? You're trespassing on our generosity.

THOMAS
I'll try to make myself useful.

MR CARSON
Just find somewhere to go.

[Thomas leaves in shock.]

--
[00:03:54, INT. DRAWING ROOM - EVENING]
[Branson enters purposefully. Everyone stares.]

ROBERT
Yes?

[Edith tenses in anticipation. Branson looks at Sybil.]

BRANSON
I'm here.

[Sybil gets up and walks over to Branson.]

LADY SYBIL
I don't think this is such a good idea. We mustn't worry Granny.

BRANSON
You've asked me to come, and I've come.

VIOLET
Would someone please tell me what is going on, or have we all stepped through the looking glass?

BRANSON
Your grandmother has as much right to know as anybody else.

VIOLET
Why don't I find that reassuring?

--
[00:04:25, INT. KITCHENS - EVENING]

MRS PATMORE
Ooh, how much longer is Mr Carson going to be? This is why it's never worth trying to make food interesting in the servants' hall. You're very quiet this evening.

DAISY MASON
I've had a letter of Mr Mason, William's dad.

MRS PATMORE
Oh, yes? What does he want?

DAISY MASON
To see me.

MRS PATMORE
Oh, there's nothing very wonderful in that. You're his daughter-in-law, why shouldn't he see you?

DAISY MASON
I wish it were as simple.

MRS PATMORE
Well, I think it is, but I'll not reopen the wound.

--
[00:04:51, INT. DRAWING ROOM - EVENING]
[Mary is standing up facing Robert.]

ROBERT
What do you mean, "you knew"?

LADY MARY
I hoped it would blow over. I didn't want to split the family when Sybil might still wake up.

ROBERT
And all the time, you've been driving me about, bowing and scraping and seducing my daughter behind my back?

BRANSON
I don't bow and scrape! And I've not seduced anyone! Give your daughter some credit for knowing her own mind!

ROBERT
How dare you speak to me in that tone. You will leave at once.

LADY SYBIL
Oh, Papa!

ROBERT
This is a folly! A ridiculous, juvenile madness!

[Violet holds up her hand.]

VIOLET
Sybil, what do you have in mind?

ROBERT
Mama, this is hardly—

[Violet holds up her hand.]

VIOLET
No. She must have something in mind. Otherwise, she wouldn't have summoned him here tonight.

LADY SYBIL
Thank you, Granny. Yes, we do have a plan. Tom's got a job on a paper. I'll stay until after the wedding; I don't want to steal their thunder.

[Sybil indicates Mary and Lavinia.]

LADY SYBIL
But after that, I'll go to Dublin.

CORA
To live with him? Unmarried?

LADY SYBIL
I'll live with his mother while the bans are read. And then we'll be married...

[Sybil and Branson gaze into each other's eyes.]

LADY SYBIL
And I'll get a job as a nurse.

VIOLET
What does your mother make of this?

BRANSON
If you must know, she thinks we're very foolish.

VIOLET (chuckles)
So at least we have something in common.

[Robert, who has been facing the wall, whips around and storms into the centre of the room.]

ROBERT
I won't allow it! I will not allow my daughter to throw away her life!

LADY SYBIL
You can posture it all you like, Papa, it won't make any difference!

ROBERT
Oh, yes, it will.

LADY SYBIL
How? I don't want any money and you can hardly lock me up until I die! I'll say goodnight. But I can promise you one thing, tomorrow morning nothing will have changed. Tom.

[Sybil gives him a look to follow her out, leaving the rest of them in a state of shock.]

[BREAK 1]

--
[00:06:38, INT. ETHEL'S HOUSE - DAY]

ETHEL
He's not coming here.

[Ethel folds up Mr Bryant's note.]

ETHEL
I don't want him to see this place. I won't have him pity me.

MRS HUGHES
The question is, are you prepared to let them into Charlie's life?

ETHEL
I suppose so, yes.

MRS HUGHES
Good. I'll ask them to Downton for Monday at four. And this time, it'll be all above board.

--
[00:07:02, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - DAY]

O'BRIEN
Can't have expected to live here free forever.

THOMAS
I didn't expect to get booted out.

O'BRIEN
You'll have to find some work.

THOMAS
It's not that easy. Every Tom, Dick, and Harry's looking for work these days and they don't all have a hand like a Jules Verne experiment.

[Branson enters.]

ANNA
Mr Branson, I know it wasn't easy last night.

BRANSON
We should've spoken out long ago.

DAISY MASON
Spoken out about what?

BRANSON
Oh, why not? Lady Sybil and I are getting married.

[Carson enters and the servants stand.]

MR CARSON
Have you no shame?

BRANSON
I'm sorry you feel like that, Mr Carson. You're a good man. But no, I have no shame. In fact, I have great pride in the love of that young woman and I will strive to be worthy of it.

MR CARSON
I will not disgrace myself by discussing the topic, and nor will anyone else. Now, if you will go, Mr Branson, we will continue with our day. Leave an address where we may forward what is owing to you.

BRANSON
No problem there, Mr Carson. I'll be at the Grantham Arms in the village until Lady Sybil is ready to make her departure. I bid you all a good day.

JANE
Is it really true--?

MR CARSON
Please. I have asked for silence and silence I will have.

--
[00:08:24, INT. GREAT HALL - DAY]
[Lavinia puts a record on the gramophone as Violet enters the house.]

VIOLET
What on earth is it?

LAVINIA
A gramophone. Some cousins of mine have given it to us.

VIOLET
I should stand well clear when you light blue touchpaper.

--
[00:08:39, INT. DRAWING ROOM - DAY]
[Violet enters while Edith is sorting the wedding presents.]

VIOLET
All on your own?

LADY EDITH
I've left space at the front for jewels. I know Lavinia's getting something from Papa.

VIOLET
And from me. Though she's so slight, a real necklace would flatten her.

[Edith and Violet chuckle.]

VIOLET
What news of Sybil?

LADY EDITH
Papa is with her now.

VIOLET
I'm afraid it'll end in tears.

LADY EDITH
Maybe. But they won't be Sybil's.

VIOLET
I used to think that Mary's beau was a misalliance, but compared to this, he's practically a Hapsburg.

[Edith smiles for a moment.]

VIOLET
Oh, don't worry. Your turn will come.

LADY EDITH
Will it? Or am I just to be the maiden aunt? Isn't this what they do? Arrange presents for their pretty relations?

VIOLET
Don't be defeatist, dear, it's very middle class. Now, I better go up and support your father.

--
[00:09:31, INT. LADY SYBIL'S BEDROOM - DAY]

LADY SYBIL
Your threats are hollow, don't you see? "I won't be received in London. I won't be welcome at court." How do I make you understand? I couldn't care less.

[Robert is about to reply when Violet knocks and enters.]

VIOLET
I do hope I'm interrupting something.

ROBERT
I only wish you were, but I seem to be getting nowhere. Have you seen Cora?

VIOLET
Ah-ha. She's lying down, and can we blame her? Now, Sybil, dear, this sort of thing is all very well in novels, but in reality, it can prove very uncomfortable. And while I am sure Branson has many virtues…

[Robert is about to protest.]

VIOLET
Well, no, no. He's a good driver.

LADY SYBIL
I will not give him up!

ROBERT
Don't be rude to your grandmother.

VIOLET
No, she's not being rude, just wrong.

LADY SYBIL
This is my offer: I will stay one week to avoid the impression I've run away, and because I don't want to spoil Matthew's wedding. And then we will marry in Dublin and whoever wishes to visit will be very welcome.

ROBERT
Out of the question.

LADY SYBIL
Will you forbid Mary and Edith?

VIOLET
No, don't, don't. Don't say anything you may have to retract.

ROBERT
Know this: there will be no more money. From here on in, your life will be very different.

LADY SYBIL
Well, bully for that.

--
[00:10:47, INT. MR CARSON'S OFFICE - DAY]
[Mrs Hughes knocks on the door and enters with a tray.]

MRS HUGHES
I thought this might [?] you off--

[Mr Carson tries to rise as she enters, but he's obviously not well.]

MRS HUGHES
Mr Carson, whatever's the matter?

MR CARSON
Oh, I 'm sure I'll be all right if I can just stay still for a moment.

[Mr Carson sinks back into his chair and Mrs Hughes puts down the tray.]

MRS HUGHES
You will not stay still, not down here. Get to bed this minute. I'll send for the doctor.

MR CARSON
I can't. We've got the Crawleys tonight and Miss Swire. What with this business of Lady Sybil.

MRS HUGHES
I'll deal with it.

[She helps him up.]

MR CARSON
Get Mr Molesley to help.

MRS HUGHES
There's no need.

MR CARSON
I mean it. The war is no longer an excuse for sloppy presentation.

MRS HUGHES
Oh, very well, I'll ask him, but only on condition you go to bed.

[Mrs Hughes helps Carson to his room.]

--
[00:11:26, INT. LADY GRANTHAM'S BEDROOM - EVENING]
[Cora heaves an exhausted sigh.]

O'BRIEN
Are you too hot in that, my lady? We still have time to change.

CORA
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

[O'Brien leaves and Cora sinks into a chair.]

CORA
So, what do we do next?

ROBERT
God knows. This is what comes of spoiling her. The mad clothes, the nursing. What were we thinking of?

CORA
That's not fair. She's a wonderful nurse and she's worked very hard.

ROBERT
But in the process, she's forgotten who she is.

CORA
Has she, Robert? Or have we overlooked who she really is?

ROBERT
If you're turning American on me, I'll go downstairs.

[Cora sighs and Robert leaves.]

--
[00:12:10, INT. SERVE ROOM - EVENING]

ANNA
Mr Carson likes to serve two white wines, which you should open and decant just before they eat. A light one for the hors d'oeuvres, then a heavy one with the soup. Keep that going for the fish, and then change to the Claret, which you should really decant now. There's a pudding wine, and after that whatever they want in the drawing room with their coffee.

MR MOLESLEY
Blimey, it's a wonder they make it up the stairs.

ANNA
They don't drink much of any of it. Now, let me show you the decanters. These four...

--
[00:12:36, INT. STAIRCASE - EVENING]

CORA
So I don't have to receive that terrible man again.

MRS HUGHES
It won't be necessary. They'll meet Ethel here, but the--

[Cora stops to lean on the banister.]

MRS HUGHES
Should you be downstairs, milady?

CORA
Oh, I'm perfectly all right, thank you.

[Cora continues down the stairs.]

--
[00:12:50, INT. KITCHENS - EVENING]

THOMAS
Why Molesley? I could've done it.

MRS PATMORE
But you always make a mountain out of not being a servant.

THOMAS
I'm just trying to be helpful.

MRS PATMORE
I'm afraid "being helpful" is not something we associate you with.

[Thomas walks off.]

MRS PATMORE
Ooh, it's wonderful what fear can do to the human spirit.

--
[00:13:08, INT. SERVE ROOM - EVENING]

ANNA
You quite right, Mr Molesley?

MR MOLESLEY
Yes, I just want to be absolutely sure that this is the lighter wine.

[Molesley pours himself a glass.]

JANE
What does it matter as long as it's white.

MR MOLESLEY
No. I believe in starting the way you mean to go on. Don't want to get off on the wrong foot.

--
[00:13:30, INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING]

VIOLET
I'm glad you're here, Sybil, dear. I was afraid you'd have a tray in your room.

ROBERT
Maybe you should have done.

LADY SYBIL
Why? I'm nor eloping like a thief in the night. I might have once, but Mary and Edith talked me out of it.

[Mary and Edith stare at her for outing them.]

VIOLET
Oh? The plot thickens.

ISOBEL
After all, Sybil's had enough time to think about it--

MATTHEW
Mother, it is not for us to have an opinion.

[Molesley falters in pouring Matthew's wine.]

MATTHEW
Mr Molesley, are you quite well?

MR MOLESLEY
I--I'm all right, thank you, sir.

MATTHEW
I don't believe you are.

CORA
The awful truth is, I'm not quite all right and I'm afraid I'm going to ask you to excuse me.

ROBERT
I'm so sorry.

[The men stand as Cora gets up from the table.]

ROBERT
Would you like us to call Dr Clarkson?

CORA
No, no, darling, it's too late.

ANNA
He's coming anyway, Your Lordship, for Mr Carson.

LADY EDITH
I-- I'll bring him up when he arrives.

ROBERT
I can sleep in my dressing room.

--
[00:14:21, INT. SERVANTS' CORRIDOR - EVENING]
[Bates turns the corner as Anna walks down the corridor.]

ANNA
Oh. I'm glad I've got you.

MR BATES
Aren't you serving?

ANNA
They're on the main course, so I can spare a moment. I've been thinking and, erm, I have to say something that you won't agree with. We're going to get married.

MR BATES
Don't be silly. We can't. Not now.

ANNA
You're not listening. You're going to Ripon tomorrow afternoon to take out a special license - I don't care how much it costs - and fix a day. We'll tell no one, but this you will do.

MR BATES
I can't.

ANNA
Aren't I as strong as Lady Sybil?

MR BATES
I don't doubt that.

ANNA
Well, then. If she can do it, so can we. That's what I've been thinking. I have stuck by you through thick and thin.

MR BATES
Thin and thin, more like.

ANNA
Mr Bates, if we have to face this, then we will face it as husband and wife. I will not be moved to the sidelines to watch how you fair from a distance with no right even to be kept informed. I will be your next of kin, and you cannot deny me that.

JANE
Anna! You better come, quick.

[Anna goes with Jane.]

--
[00:15:34, INT. SERVE ROOM - EVENING]
[Molesley moans and puts a handkerchief to his face.]

ANNA
Mr Molesley? What's happened? Haven't you taken that in yet?

MR MOLESLEY
I'm not well. I'm not well at all.

JANE
First Mr Carson, then Her Ladyship, and now him.

ANNA
Help him down to the servants' hall. The doctor can take a look at him, too, when he gets here.

[Anna grabs the decanter and enters the dining room.]

--
[00:15:54, INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING]

ROBERT
The Spanish flu has found its way to Yorkshire.

ISOBEL
And to Downton. Dr Clarkson says he's got ten cases already.

[Anna pours Violet's drink.]

ROBERT
Ah, I thought Molesley had joined the temperance league.

ANNA
I'm afraid he's been taken ill, milord. I am sorry.

ROBERT
Molesley, too? Good heavens, everyone's falling like ninepins.

[Lavinia swoons in her chair.]

LADY MARY
Lavinia?

LAVINIA
Do you know, I'm not at all well either. I wonder if I could lay down for a minute?

LADY MARY
Of course. Come to my room. They'll have lit the fire by now.

[Mary and Lavinia get up from the table. The men stand as they exit.]

LAVINIA
Excuse me.

ISOBEL
Do you think we should take her home?

MATTHEW
No, let her rest for a moment.

ISOBEL
Well, I—-I think I should go and help.

[Isobel gets up and exits.]

VIOLET
Wasn't there a masked ball in Paris when cholera broke out? Half the guests were dead before they left the ballroom.

ROBERT
Thank you, Mama. That's cheered us up no end.

[BREAK 2]

--
[00:17:03, INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - EVENING]

MRS HUGHES
I'll take you to Mr Carson now, and then to see Mr Molesley in the servants' hall.

[Robert turns the corner.]

ROBERT
Dr Clarkson, you're kind to come. How is she?

DR CLARKSON
Not too bad, I see. But she'll need some nursing for a day or two.

ROBERT
Oh, don't worry about that. All our daughters are professionals. Let's leave her to get some rest.

[Mary and Isobel approach.]

LADY MARY
Miss Swire may be another victim, but she's sleeping now, so I don't want to disturb her.

DR CLARKSON
When she wakes, give her some aspirin and cinnamon in milk and keep her here. I'll look at her in the morning. I better go to Carson.

ISOBEL
I'll come, too.

[Clarkson takes a breath and rolls his eyes, but follows Mrs Hughes without a word.]

--
[00:17:39, INT. GREAT HALL - EVENING]
[Matthew puts on the gramophone. Mary watches him from the balcony for a moment before descending the stairs.]

LADY MARY
Where is everyone?

MATTHEW
I'm not sure. Cousin Violet's gone home.

LADY MARY
What about you?

MATTHEW
I'm waiting for Lavinia and Mother.

LADY MARY
Dr Clarkson wants Lavinia to stay here. He'll see her tomorrow.

[Mary listens to the music.]

LADY MARY
I don't know this one.

MATTHEW
Actually, I rather like it. I think it was in a show that flopped. Zip Goes a Million, or something.

[Mary lets out an amused sigh. Matthew holds out his hands to dance with her. She steps into his arms.]

LADY MARY
Can you manage without your stick?

MATTHEW
You are my stick.

LADY MARY
Hm. We were a show that flopped.

MATTHEW
Oh, God, Mary.

[The music fades and transitions into the modern Downton Abbey orchestral score.]

MATTHEW
I am so, so sorry. Do you know how sorry I am?

LADY MARY
Don't be. It wasn't anyone's fault. If it was, it was mine.

MATTHEW
You know, Cousin Violet came to me and told me to marry you.

LADY MARY
When was this?

MATTHEW
A while ago. When we knew I would walk again.

LADY MARY
Classic Granny. What did you say?

MATTHEW
That I couldn't accept Lavinia's sacrifice of her life, her children, her future, and then give her the brush off when I was well again. Well, I couldn't, could I?

LADY MARY
Of course not.

MATTHEW
However much I might want to.

LADY MARY
Absolutely not.

[Mary and Matthew kiss.]

LAVINIA
Hello.

[Lavinia comes down the stairs and Mary and Matthew part.]

MATTHEW
What are you doing up?

LAVINIA
Shouldn't we be getting back?

LADY MARY
It's decided. You're staying here. Dr Clarkson's coming in the morning so he can treat all of you together. You can borrow some things until Matthew brings you what you need. I'll go and organize a room.

[Mary leaves and Matthew walks up to Lavinia.]

MATTHEW
How do you feel?

LAVINIA
Like a nuisance.

MATTHEW
You could never be that.

LAVINIA
I mean it, Matthew. Don't ever let me be a nuisance. Don't ever let me get in the way, please.

[The gramophone scratches at the end of the song.]

--
[00:21:11, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - EVENING]

O'BRIEN
I'll sleep on a chair in her room.

DR CLARKSON
Oh, no. There's no need for that.

O'BRIEN
I don't mind.

[Molesley pulls his head off the table groggily.]

MR MOLESLEY
What is it?

O'BRIEN
I'd like to be on hand.

MRS HUGHES
So, we're quite the hospital again.

DR CLARKSON
You'll probably gain some more patients over the next few day--

[Clarkson leans in as he's checking Molesley and sniffs his hair. He smiles as Molesley continues to snore at the table.]

DR CLARKSON
But you don't need to worry about Molesley. He'll be fine in the morning.

MRS HUGHES
Oh?

DR CLARKSON
Uh-huh. The others have Spanish flu. He's just drunk.

--
[00:21:41, INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT]
[Robert steps out of his dressing room when he hears footsteps. He stops, disappointed, and turns back to his room, but Jane appears.]

JANE
Oh, did you want Mr Bates, milord?

ROBERT
I forgot to say I want to be woken early.

JANE
Well, I can tell him that.

[Robert nods and starts to go back to his room.]

JANE
Freddy got in to Ripon Grammar. So, whatever you said, it worked.

ROBERT
Marvellous. Some good news at last.

JANE
I hate to hear you talk like that.

ROBERT
I'm sorry, that was selfish of me to spoil your happy moment.

JANE
You need never say "sorry" to me. How are you, really?

ROBERT
Since you ask, I'm wretched. I lost my youngest child today, I suspect forever, and I can't see any way around it.

JANE
I wish you knew how much I want to help.

ROBERT
Do you?

JANE
I think you know I do.

[Robert holds out his hand and Jane takes it. He leads her into his dressing room.]

--
[00:22:49, INT. MR CARSON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT]

MR CARSON
I'll see if I can get up tomorrow.

MRS HUGHES
Don't be foolish. You're ill. And in all probability, you're going to be a lot iller in the morning.

MR CARSON
But how will you manage? And what about the wedding?

MRS HUGHES
I'm not sure there'll even be a wedding. But either way, I won't burden you with it.

MR CARSON
P-- perhaps Mr Molesley could come on a permanent basis until I'm better.

MRS HUGHES
I doubt that's a solution, Mr Carson. Neither my patience nor his liver could stand it.

[Mrs Hughes gestures for him to drink up his medicine.]

--
[00:23:20, INT. LORD GRANTHAM'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT]
[Robert snogs the maid. Bates knocks at the door and opens it, but Robert is already at the door and prevents him from opening it any further while Jane hides in the corner.]

ROBERT
Who is it?

MR BATES
I'm sorry, my lord, we never settled a time you wanted to be woken.

ROBERT
Early, I think, with everyone ill. Seven. I'll breakfast at half past.

MR BATES
Very good, milord. Goodnight.

[Bates leaves and Robert closes the door and closes his eyes.]

ROBERT
This isn't fair. I'm placing you in an impossible situation.

JANE
I want to be with you. Let me.

[Jane tries to kiss him, but he takes her hands and pulls back.]

JANE
I see. You don't want me now.

ROBERT
I want you with every fibre of my being, but it isn't fair to you; it isn't fair to anyone. I wish I were different. I wish everything were different.

JANE
I don't want you different. I like you the way you are.

ROBERT (sigh)
Thank you for that. I will cherish it. Truly.

[She tries to kiss him again, but he won't let her. He opens the door and checks the hall, then returns to the room and Jane leaves.]

--
[00:25:21, INT. LADY GRANTHAM'S BEDROOM - MORNING]
[Mrs Hughes enters as Edith and O'Brien nurse Cora.]

MRS HUGHES
What can I bring to help?

O'BRIEN
Ice to bring her temperature down.

LADY MARY
Mrs Hughes, Sir Richard telephoned this morning. He's coming down to help. I wonder if you could have some rooms made ready for him and his valet, and tell Mrs Patmore.

MRS HUGHES
Very good, milady.

--
[00:25:49, INT. GRANTHAM ARMS - DAY]
[Robert walks through the village to the inn.]

BRANSON
But I don't accept that I am ruining her life. Nor that I'm cutting her off from her family. If you want to cut her off, that's your decision.

ROBERT
But how will you look after her? How can you hope to provide for her?

BRANSON
With respect, milord, you seem to think that she can only be happy in some version of Downton Abbey when it's obvious that if she wanted that life, she would not be marrying me.

[Robert tosses his hat and cane on the bed.]

ROBERT
Very well.

[Robert sits in a chair.]

ROBERT
I'd hoped to avoid this, but I see that I can't.

[Robert pulls out a check book and pen and opens it on the table next to him.]

ROBERT
How much will you take to leave us in peace?

[Branson is stunned.]

BRANSON
What?

ROBERT
You must have doubts. You said your own mother thinks you foolish.

BRANSON
Yes, she does.

ROBERT
Then yield to those doubts and take enough to make a new life back in Ireland. I'll be generous if we can bring this nonsense to an end.

BRANSON (scoffs)
I see. You know, your trouble, milord, you're like all of your kind. You think you have the monopoly of honour.

[Robert looks up sharply from writing his check.]

BRANSON
Doesn't it occur to you that I might believe the best guarantee of Sybil's happiness lies with me?

ROBERT
Well!

[Robert puts his check book away and stands up.]

ROBERT
If you are not prepared to listen to reason--

BRANSON
I'm not prepared to listen to insults.

ROBERT
Then I will bid you a good day.

[Robert picks up his hat and cane.]

BRANSON
ROBERT
And I want you to leave the village.

BRANSON
Even though she'll come to me the moment I call? Do you really want me to leave now when I will take her with me that same hour?

[Robert leaves without a word.]

--
[00:27:22, INT. GREAT HALL - DAY]

ISOBEL
Ah, there you are. Dr Clarkson's here. Cora's not at all well. Sybil and Edith are with her. Mary's gone to meet Sir Richard from the train.

ROBERT
What's he come for?

ISOBEL
I gather he wants to be useful.

ROBERT
I don't see how.

MRS HUGHES
Milord, we're two more maids down. I hope you can forgive some catch as catch can in the days ahead.

ROBERT
Which maids? Not Jane?

MRS HUGHES
No, milord, not Jane.

[Mrs Hughes turns away and looks confused. Robert heads up the stairs and a maid takes a bowl from Edith who is descending.]

ROBERT
What are they doing?

LADY EDITH
Decorations for the wedding. It still hasn't been cancelled. Until it is, they have to prepare for it.

--
[00:27:58, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - DAY]

MRS HUGHES
If Anna or Jane appear, tell them to come and help me do the room for Sir Richard. I'll be in Armada.

[Thomas takes the sheets from Mrs Hughes.]

THOMAS
I can help you with the bedroom, then I'll set up a room for his man, and I'll serve at dinner.

MRS HUGHES
But I've no money to pay you.

THOMAS
Call it rent.

--
[00:28:10, INT. LAVINIA'S GUEST BEDROOM - DAY]

ISOBEL
The awful truth is, the wedding simply cannot go ahead.

MATTHEW
Oh, don't say that.

ISOBEL
I must. Dr Clarkson says you'll be groggy for at least a week, maybe even longer. We have to face the facts.

LAVINIA
What about my father?

ISOBEL
Well, Matthew can telephone him.

LAVINIA
He can't come here while everyone's ill. He has a weak chest and mustn't take the risk.

MATTHEW
All right. Well, I suppose we've made a decision, then. To delay.

LAVINIA
I don't think we've got any choice.

ISOBEL
No, I'm afraid we don't.

[Matthew and Isobel exit.]

MATTHEW
At least she doesn't seem too serious.

ISOBEL
No, no. I'd say she's been lucky. But I am terribly sorry about the wedding.

MATTHEW
These things are sent to try us.

--
[00:28:54, INT. LADY GRANTHAM'S BEDROOM - DAY]

ROBERT
Why didn't anyone tell me she was like this?

LADY SYBIL
She took a turn for the worse about half an hour ago. Where were you?

ROBERT
Out. I went for a walk.

[O'Brien enters with a fresh bowl of water and places a cloth over Cora's forehead.]

O'BRIEN
There we are, my lady. That's better, isn't it?

LADY SYBIL (whisper)
She's been with her all night.

ROBERT
O'Brien, you must have a rest.

Not just now, milord. If you don't mind, I want to see her through the worst if I can. Now, I'll just make this colder for you.

[O'Brien dips the cloth in the water. Robert takes Sybil aside.]

ROBERT
How is she, really? Tell me the truth.

LADY SYBIL
I can't yet. Dr Clarkson says we will know more in a few hours.

ROBERT
God Almighty, how can this be? My whole life gone over a cliff in the course of a single day.

[BREAK 3]

--
[00:29:47, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - DAY]
[One of the serving bells rings. Bates turns to one of the extra servants.]

MR BATES
Take care of that, thank you.

[The servant leaves as Anna enters.]

MR BATES
How're you doing?

ANNA
I'm not sure. Her Ladyship's worse.

MR BATES
I'm sorry.

ANNA
Jane said you wanted to see me.

MR BATES
It's only to say that I've done it. I've booked the registrar.

[Anna beams.]

ANNA
When for?

MR BATES
He's had a cancellation, so it's...it's Friday afternoon.

ANNA
This Friday?

[Ethel enters with Charlie.]

ANNA
Ethel? What are you doing here?

[Anna greats Charlie as Jane enters.]

JANE
Those Bryants have turned up agai--

ETHEL
That's what.

ANNA
I'll find Mrs Hughes and come back for you.

[Anna smiles at Bates on her way out.]

--
[00:30:27, INT. PARLOUR - DAY]

MRS HUGHES
I hope I haven't kept you waiting.

MRS BRYANT
No, no.

MRS HUGHES
I'm afraid we have illness in the house, so I hope you can excuse Lord and Lady Grantham.

MR BRYANT
It's not them we've come to see, is it? Is she here?

MRS HUGHES
She's just coming now.

[Anna opens the door for Ethel and Charlie.]

MRS BRYANT
May I meet him properly?

ETHEL
Come along, Charlie.

[She carries him to Mrs Bryant, both of them smiling.]

ETHEL
This nice lady is your grandmother.

MRS BRYANT
Perhaps you could call me Gran.

MRS HUGHES
He's a stout little chap, isn't he?

MRS BRYANT
And so like Charles. I thought it when we were last here. I know what was said at the time and Mr Bryant's sorry for it now, but I could see he was just like Charles.

MR BRYANT
Never mind all that. Let's get down to business.

ETHEL
Business?

MRS HUGHES
MR BRYANT
That's what you want from us, isn't it? Find out what we mean to do for little Charlie in the future.

--
[00:31:30, INT. KITCHENS - DAY]

DAISY MASON
What do you mean, "she might die"?

O'BRIEN
What do you think happens with a fatal illness? The fairy's come?

MRS PATMORE
By heaven, if anything happens to her, it won't be your fault, Miss O'Brien. I've never seen such care.

O'BRIEN
I wish I could talk to her, that's all, but she doesn't know me.

MRS PATMORE
I'm sure she knows how hard you've worked for her.

O'BRIEN
It's not that. There's something I need...Never mind. Either I will or I won't.

[O'Brien takes the tray and exits.]

MRS PATMORE
You never know people, do you? You can work with them for twenty years and you don't know them at all.

--
[00:32:07, INT. PARLOUR - DAY]

ETHEL
What? You mean, give him up? Never see him again?

MR BRYANT
Those are my terms.

MRS HUGHES
But...would it hurt if Ethel were to care for him in your own house? She could be his nurse.

MRS BRYANT
That might be possible.

ETHEL
MRS HUGHES
MR BRYANT
Of course she can't be his nurse. Just think for a minute. We mean to bring him up as a gentleman, send him to [Harrowsay?] and Oxford, and all the while his mother's down in the servants' hall? How does that work?

ETHEL
Well, I-- I could.

MR BRYANT
No, no, no. Don't you see? We want to raise him as our grandson, not as a housemaid's bastard.

MRS BRYANT
Well, he has to know the truth sometime.

MR BRYANT
Maybe. But not for a long time. Till then, his father had a wartime marriage until he died, and his mother succumbed to Spanish flu.

MRS BRYANT
A lot of people have.

MRS HUGHES
We've quite a few upstairs.

MR BRYANT
And that, for many years at least, is all that Charlie will be told.

ETHEL
So, I'm just to be written out? Painted over, buried?

MR BRYANT
What matters is what's good for Charlie.

ETHEL
No. What's good for Charlie, and what's good for you?

[Ethel stands up angry. She walks over to Mrs Bryant.]

ETHEL
You've got a heart, I know you have. You see what he's asking?

[Mr Bryant stands.]

MR BRYANT
Ethel, consider this: in the world as it is, compare the two futures. The first as my heir, educated, privileged, rich, able to do what he wants, to marry whom he likes. The second as the bastard son--

[Mrs Hughes stands up.]

MRS HUGHES
I think we've heard enough of that word for one day.

MR BRYANT
Very well. As the...nameless offshoot of drudge. You're his mother. Which would you choose for him?

ETHEL
Suppose I could be his nurse and never tell him who I am? Suppose I promised that?

[Mrs Bryant stands.]

MRS BRYANT
Surely--

MR BRYANT
Come on, we all know that's a promise you could never keep.

[Anna enters.]

ANNA
I'm sorry, Mrs Hughes. We must send for the doctor to come at once. Her Ladyship's much worse.

MRS BRYANT
I--I'm afraid--

MR BRYANT
Go where you're needed, we've has our say, and you know how to reach us when you've made your decision.

[Mrs Bryant and Ethel exchange a look.]

MR BRYANT
Come along Daphne.

--
[00:34:08, INT. LADY GRANTHAM'S BEDROOM - DAY]
[O'Brien continues to nurse Cora alone.]

CORA
O'Brien? Is that you, O'Brien?

[O'Brien smiles.]

O'BRIEN
Yes, milady. It's me, milady.

CORA
You're so good to me. You've always been so good to me.

O'BRIEN
Not always, milady.

CORA
So good.

O'BRIEN
No. And the fact is, I want to ask so much for your forgiveness, because I did something once which I bitterly regret. Bitterly. And if you could only know how much--

CORA
So very good.

[Cora is clearly still delirious. Robert enters.]

ROBERT
How is she?

O'BRIEN
She slept and she seemed better, then suddenly the fever came back.

ROBERT
O'Brien, thank you for the way you've looked after her. I mean it, I'm very grateful, whatever comes.

--
[00:35:23, INT. LAVINIA'S GUEST BEDROOM]
[Isobel sits by Lavinia's bedside, but stands as Matthew enters.]

MATTHEW
What a marathon, but I think I got them all. Everyone sends love. I've told your father I'll telegraph him as soon as it's safe for him to come.

LAVINIA
But not before.

ISOBEL
Well, I don't think I should leave you alone.

[Matthew sighs.]

ISOBEL
But if you don't tell.

[Matthew chuckles and Isobel leaves. He sits in the chair.]

MATTHEW
I've been thinking about the date for the rematch, and...what is it?

LAVINIA
I wonder if we haven't been rather lucky.

MATTHEW
Well, I think we've both been very lucky.

LAVINIA
That we've been given a second chance.

MATTHEW
Second chance at what?

LAVINIA
To be quite, quite sure about what we're doing.

MATTHEW
Darling, what can you mean?

LAVINIA
The thing is...I might as well say it. When I came downstairs and you and Mary were dancing, I heard what you said...and I saw what you did.

MATTHEW
But that was--

LAVINIA
No, it's not that I'm in a rage and a fury. In fact, I think it's noble of you to want to keep your word when things have changed. But I'm not sure it'd be right for me to hold you to it.

MATTHEW
Lavinia, I can explain.

LAVINIA
No, listen. I've had lots of time to think about it. I love you very, very much, and I've wanted to marry you from the first moment I saw you, all that is true. But I didn't really know what I was taking on. It's not in me to be Queen of the County. I'm a little person, an ordinary person, and when I saw you and Mary together, I thought ,"How fine. How right you look together."

MATTHEW
I-- I don't want to hear this.

LAVINIA
But you must. Because it isn't a sudden thing. I was starting to worry, and then when you were wounded, I thought it was my calling to look after you and care for you. And I don't think Mary would've done that quite as well as me, really.

MATTHEW (laughs)
No, no. No, not nearly as well.

LAVINIA
I do have some self-worth. Just not enough to make you marry the wrong person.

MATTHEW
What you're saying is pointless! Mary's marrying somebody else.

LAVINIA
Is she? We'll see.

MATTHEW
I won't let you do this.

LAVINIA
You will. But we won't fight about it now. In fact, I'm tired. Can I rest for a bit? We'll talk later.

MATTHEW
Of course.

[Matthew gets up and he sees her start to cry just before he leaves.]

--
[00:38:49, INT. DRAWING ROOM - DAY]

LADY MARY
It's good of you to come, but I don't really see what you can do.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
I just thought I better do my bit. You say the chauffeur's gone, so I could always drive the car.

LADY MARY
Preferably over the chauffeur. Hm.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
You father's not having an easy time of it. How's Lady Grantham?

LADY MARY
Not well. Clarkson's with her now.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
And Miss Swire?

LADY MARY
Oh, she's...

[Something occurs to her and she turns to face Carlisle.]

LADY MARY
Is that why you've come? Because I said Lavinia had been taken ill?

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
I was coming up anyway in a day or two for the wedding.

LADY MARY
Well, she won't be getting married on Saturday, which I suppose is what you'd like best.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
But she's not seriously ill?

LADY MARY
I see what was worrying you. If Lavinia had been carried off, you wanted to be here to stop Matthew from falling into my arms on a tidal wave of grief.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
It's a tricky disease.

[Thomas enters.]

THOMAS
His Lordship's asking for you, milady.

[Mary gathers her letters and exits]

--
[00:40:02, INT. KITCHENS - DAY]

MRS HUGHES
I think we should aim at a sort of buffet dinner. Then they can run in and out as it suits them. I'm sorry to make extra work.

MRS PATMORE
Never mind that. At times like these, we must all pull together.

MRS HUGHES
Oh, this arrived in the afternoon post, Daisy.

[Mrs Hughes hands Daisy a letter. Thomas enters.]

THOMAS
Tea for Sir Richard in the drawing room.

MRS HUGHES
Well, I'm glad to know he's here to help.

[Mrs Hughes and Mrs Patmore shake their heads while Daisy reads her letter.]

THOMAS
I can do it.

MRS HUGHES
You're very obliging, Thomas.

THOMAS
I could take some up to Mr Carson, if you'd like.

[Mrs Hughes and Mrs Patmore exchange a look.]

MRS PATMORE
Is that from your Mr Mason?

DAISY MASON
He's not mine.

MRS HUGHES
What does he say?

DAISY MASON
He just says again we should talk about William. He wants me to go to his farm.

MRS PATMORE
Oh, poor man, will you not visit him?

DAISY MASON
I'm not going to any farm.

MRS HUGHES
You're all he's got, Daisy.

DAISY MASON
Well, then he's got nobody, 'cause he hasn't got me.

--
[00:40:52, INT. LADY MARY'S BEDROOM - DAY]
[Mary enters as Anna is finishing the bed.]

ANNA
Oh, I'm sorry, milady, I didn't think you'd want to change tonight.

LADY MARY
I don't. I just need a handkerchief.

ANNA
How's Her Ladyship?

LADY MARY
Not good, I'm afraid. What is it?

ANNA
I--I don't mean to bother you, milady.

LADY MARY
Go on.

ANNA
Can you keep a secret? Well, I know you can. You see, Mr Bates and I had a plan...to get married this coming Friday.

LADY MARY
What?

ANNA
He's worried the police haven't finished with him, and if he's right, then I'm not going through it with no proper place in his life.

LADY MARY
Well, that's a very brave decision.

ANNA
Or a very stupid one. But, anyway, with Her Ladyship ill now, and half the servants on their backs, and everybody working flat out--

LADY MARY
Where is the marriage to be?

ANNA
Just in the register office in Ripon. It wouldn't take long, but--

LADY MARY
Go. I'll cover for you. We're all here, and you won't help Mama by changing your plans.

[Edith enters.]

LADY EDITH
You better come. She's worse.

[Mary rushes out with Edith.]

--
[00:41:59, INT. LADY GRANTHAM'S BEDROOM - EVENING]
[Clarkson puts on his coat to leave.]

DR CLARKSON
I've given her the epinephrine.

O'BRIEN (worried)
Doctor!

[Cora is gasping for air and her nose is bleeding.]

LADY EDITH
Oh, no. What does that mean?

DR CLARKSON
It's a haemorrhage of the mucus membranes. It's, er, it's not unusual.

[Sybil gets a bowl to Cora just in time as she vomits.]

O'BRIEN
It's all right, milady. Don't worry. Don't worry a bit. Everything's going to be all right.

ROBERT (whisper)
Everything is clearly not all right. How bad is it?

DR CLARKSON (low voice)
If she lasts through the night, she'll live.

[Mary, Edith, and Robert absorb this shock.]

DR CLARKSON
What about the others?

LADY MARY
Come with me.

DR CLARKSON
I'll be back shortly.

--
[00:42:38, INT. MR CARSON'S BEDROOM - EVENING]

DR CLARKSON
I've given some medicine to Mrs Hughes. She'll bring it up later.

MR CARSON
I gather Her Ladyship is not improving.

DR CLARKSON
Ah, well, er...we'll know more tomorrow.

MR CARSON
And Miss Swire?

DR CLARKSON
Not too bad, I think. I'll go to her when I've seen the rest of the servants.

[Someone knocks just as Clarkson heads for the door and he opens it.]

DR CLARKSON
Ah.

[Clarkson exits as Thomas brings in a tray, to Mr Carson's shock.]

THOMAS
Thank you, sir. Here we are, Mr Carson. Now, have you got everything you need?

[Carson nods.]

THOMAS
Milady.

[Thomas exits cheerfully.]

MR CARSON
I wan-- I want to thank you for coming up, my lady.

LADY MARY
Not at all.

MR CARSON
No, no, I mean it. I know I've been a disappointment to you.

LADY MARY
Maybe. But I've relied on your support for too long to do without it entirely.

MR CARSON
You'll always have my support, my lady.

LADY MARY
And you mine. On which subject...

[Mary brings Carson's dinner tray to him.]

LADY MARY
I should be careful of Thomas.

MR CARSON
I don't know how we're to get rid of him after all this.

LADY MARY
But I doubt he'll want to stay a footman forever, so watch out.

--
[00:43:51, INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING]
[Thomas waits on the buffet dinner party in full livery.]

LADY MARY
You look very smart, Thomas.

THOMAS
Well, I still have the shirt, milady, and I found my livery in the cupboard, so I thought, why not?

[Mary finishes serving up her own plate and walks over to sit next to Matthew.]

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
I have a place for you here.

[Mary pauses awkwardly and goes to sit next to Carlisle.]

ISOBEL
How's Lavinia?

MATTHEW
All right, I think. The illness has made her rather...confused.

LADY MARY
What do you mean?

[Sybil rushes in, wearing her nursing uniform.]

LADY SYBIL
Matthew! Mary!

[Everyone gets up.]

LADY MARY
Is it Mama?

LADY SYBIL
That's what's so...it's Lavinia.

[Everyone rushes out except Carlisle. He grabs Mary's arm on her way out.]

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
Let him go to her. Let him be with her. Surely you owe her that.

[Mary slips out of his grasp and leaves without a word.]

--
[00:44:48, INT. LAVINIA'S GUEST BEDROOM - EVENING]

ISOBEL
What happened?

DR CLARKSON
This is how I found her. It's bad, I'm afraid. Very bad.

[Lavinia seems to be struggling to breathe.]

DR CLARKSON
The worst.

MATTHEW
I don't understand. When I was with her, she was talking, she was fine.

DR CLARKSON
It's-- it's a strange disease with sudden, savage changes. I'm terribly sorry.

MATTHEW
Well, what can I do? Can I talk to her?

DR CLARKSON
Yes, of course.

[Matthew sits in the chair next to the bed and takes Lavinia's hand. The men step away and turn their backs, but the women watch.]

MATTHEW
My darling, can you hear me? It's me. It's Matthew.

LAVINIA
Matthew. I'm so glad you're here.

MATTHEW
Of course I'm here. Darling, where else would I be?

LAVINIA
Isn't this better, really?

MATTHEW
I don't understand you.

LAVINIA
You won't have to make a hard decision. Be happy, for my sake. Promise me. It's all I want for you. Remember that. That's all I want.

MATTHEW
But I can't be happy. Not without you. How could I be happy?

[Lavinia dies. Isobel steps forward and the gentlemen turn back around. Clarkson checks her pulse, then places a hand on Matthew's shoulder and steps away.]

[BREAK 4]

--
[00:47:14, INT. GREAT HALL - DAY]
[Matthew walks to Downton wearing a black armband, looking like a zombie. He enter the great hall and sees servants taking the garlands down from the staircase.]

MATTHEW
What are you doing?

THOMAS
They were put up for the wedding, Mr Crawley.

[Robert approaches Matthew.]

ROBERT
My dear chap, I cannot find the words to say how sorry I am.

MATTHEW
How is Cousin Cora?

ROBERT
Much better, thank you.

MATTHEW
Glad to hear it. I came up to see if there's anything I need to do.

ROBERT
We've taken care of all that. As you know, we always use Graspy's.

MATTHEW
Of course.

ROBERT
Travis has suggested Monday for the funeral to give people time to get here. It'll be in tomorrow's paper.

MATTHEW
That's very kind of you.

ROBERT
I know Mary wanted to--

MATTHEW
No.

ROBERT
--see you.

MATTHEW
I mean, I...don't really want to see anyone. Not yet. Now I know everything's settled, I'll go back.

ROBERT
When you speak to her father, do ask him to stay here

MATTHEW
Thank you. He'll be...very grateful.

ROBERT
Just tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it.

[Matthew zombie walks away.]

--
[00:48:44, INT. MR CARSON'S BEDROOM - DAY]
[Mrs Hughes gives Mr Carson his medicine.]

MRS HUGHES
Are you feeling more yourself?

MR CARSON
A bit. I still can't get over it.

MRS HUGHES
I hope you'll not pretend you liked her now.

MR CARSON
I didn't want her here, Mrs Hughes, I'll admit, but I had no objection to her being happy somewhere else.

--
[00:49:04, INT. LADY GRANTHAM'S BEDROOM - DAY]

ROBERT
A sight to gladden my heart.

CORA
Is it? I hope it is.

ROBERT
You gave us quite a fright.

CORA
They told me about Lavinia.

ROBERT
The funeral is on Monday.

CORA
I'd like to go if I can.

[Cora lays her hand on the bed for Robert to take. He takes it.]

CORA
We're all right, aren't we Robert?

[Robert looks at her face, narrows his eyes, and the replies.]

ROBERT
Of course we are.

CORA
Only I know I got so caught up in everything, I think I neglected you, and if I did, I'm sorry.

ROBERT
Don't apologize to me.

--
[00:49:54, INT. MRS HUGHES'S SITTING ROOM - EVENING]
[Ethel knocks and enters while Mrs Hughes is having her tea.]

MRS HUGHES
Ethel! Whatever are you doing here at this time of night?

ETHEL
I said I'd be back with my answer, and here I am.

MRS HUGHES
You know we're a house in mourning.

ETHEL
Yes. And I'm sorry. But if anything, it's made my mind up for me. Life is short and what's my life without Charlie? They're not having him.

MRS HUGHES (nods)
As long as you're sure.

ETHEL
They say they can do better for him, but what's better than his mother's love? Fancy me that.

[Mrs Hughes smiles a little.]

MRS HUGHES
I'll write and tell them.

[Ethel smiles a little as she steps toward the door.]

ETHEL
You agree with me, though, don't you?

MRS HUGHES
My opinion has no place in this.

[Ethel nods and leaves.]

--
[00:50:52, EXT/INT. RIPON REGISTER OFFICE - DAY]
[Anna arrives with flowers and takes Mr Bates's arm. On their way inside, they pass a newlywed couple.]

REGISTRAR
"I, John Bates,"

MR BATES
I, John Bates...

REGISTRAR
"Take thee, Anna Mae Smith,"

MR BATES
Take thee, Anna Mae Smith...

REGISTRAR
"To be my wedded wife."

MR BATES
To be my wedded wife.

REGISTRAR
"I, Anna Mae Smith,"

ANNA
I, Anna Mae Smith...

REGISTRAR
"Take thee, John Bates..."

ANNA
Take thee, John Bates...

REGISTRAR
"To be my wedded husband."

ANNA
To be my wedded husband.

REGISTRAR
And now the ring.

[Bates puts the ring on the tip of Anna's finger.]

REGISTRAR
"With this ring, I plight thee my troth"

MR BATES
With this ring, I plight thee my troth...

REGISTRAR
"As a symbol of all we have promised."

MR BATES
As a symbol of all we have promised.

REGISTRAR
And all that we share.

MR BATES
And all that we share.

[Bates slides the ring the rest of the way onto Anna's finger. They beam at each other.]

REGISTRAR
It, therefore, gives me great pleasure to say you are now husband and wife together.

[They kiss.]

--
[00:52:15, INT. LIBRARY - DAY]
[Robert writes at his desk. Jane enters.]

JANE
You rang, milord?

ROBERT
I keep forgetting Carson's ill.

JANE
Mrs Hughes says he's much better.

ROBERT
I really want Bates, he'd gone out earlier.

JANE
He's in the dressing room. He went up with your evening shirt.

[Robert checks his watch.]

ROBERT
Golly, is that the time?

[Robert gets up and Jane turns to leave.]

ROBERT
Actually, can you stay a moment? I was trying to think how to contrive a meeting and here you are. You see--

JANE
I'm glad Lady Grantham's better. Truly. and don't worry, there's no harm done.

ROBERT
No harm done yet.

JANE
I'm almost packed...and I've given in my notice.

[Robert stares for a moment, then nods. He takes a note from his desk and hands it to her.]

ROBERT
This is the name and address of my man of business.

JANE
Why? You don't owe me anything.

ROBERT
It's not for you. It's for Freddy. Let me give him a start in life.

[Jane shakes her head and tries to look anywhere but Robert.]

JANE
I'm not sure.

ROBERT
It would make me very happy.

JANE
If I thought that, then I'd take it gladly. Will you be happy? Really?

ROBERT
I have no right to be unhappy, which is almost the same.

JANE
Almost. Not quite. Can I kiss you before I go?

[Robert leans in and kisses her. She starts to cry as they part. She exits and he stares after her.]

--
[00:55:16, INT. LADY MARY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT]
[Mary shakes her head.]

LADY MARY
The secret Mrs Bates.

[Anna and Mary smile.]

ANNA BATES
We will tell everyone, but I thought we should leave it for a while. At least 'til after the funeral, anyway.

LADY MARY
You'll have to control yourselves.

ANNA BATES
Well, we've had enough practice.

[Anna finishes braiding Mary's hair and Mary walks toward the door.]

LADY MARY
Come with me.

[Anna follows Mary down the corridor. Mary looks back at her and smiles.]

--
[00:55:50, INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT]
[Mary shows Anna a guest bedroom with flowers on the bed and candles everywhere. Anna smiles.]

LADY MARY
Smuggle Bates in here when everyone has gone to bed. And for heaven's sake, make sure he gets the right room.

[Anna chuckles.]

ANNA BATES
I don't know what to say, milady. Who did all this?

LADY MARY
Jane. I told her. She said it would be her leaving present. You can stay all night. She won't tell.

ANNA BATES
Milady, thank you. Very, very much.

[Mary smiles.]

--
[00:56:27, INT. MR CARSON'S OFFICE - NIGHT]
[Mr Carson clears his throat as Thomas is closing up the silver cabinet.]

THOMAS
Are you sure you should be up, Mr Carson?

MR CARSON
I wanted to check the silver before tomorrow.

THOMAS
I think I've cleaned all the pieces we might need. We'll get everything ready the moment breakfast is over.

MR CARSON
Thank you for the way you've kept it all going, Thomas. I wish I knew how to express my gratitude.

THOMAS
You'll find a way, Mr Carson.

[Carson holds out his hand and Thomas gives him the silver cabinet keys.]

--
[00:57:04, INT. MRS HUGHES'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT]
[Mrs Hughes gets up from her desk and hands Jane an envelope.]

MRS HUGHES
I think that's everything we owe.

JANE
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

MRS HUGHES
I'm sorry you're going, Jane. You're a good worker. I wish you well.

JANE
I'm sorry, too, Mrs Hughes. But in the end I think it's for the best. For everyone.

MRS HUGHES
When all is said and done, my dear, you may be right.

[Jane leaves and Mrs Hughes considers the matter for a moment. She totally knows.]

--
[00:57:35, INT. HONEYMOON GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT]
[Mr and Mrs Bates lie naked under the covers, gazing at each other.]

MR BATES
Well...Mrs Bates...you've had your way with me.

[They giggle.]

MR BATES
I just hope you don't live to regret it.

ANNA BATES
I couldn't regret it. No matter what comes. I know only that I am now who I was meant to be.

MR BATES
I'm not worthy of you, that's all I know. And they'll call me names for pulling you into my troubles.

[Anna sighs.]

ANNA BATES
Mr Bates, we've waited long enough to be together, you and I, and now that we're man and wife, can we let that be enough just for this one night?

[They kiss.]

[BREAK 5]

--
[00:59:05, EXT. CEMETERY - DAY]

REVEREND TRAVIS
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

[The minister throws dirt on Lavinia's coffin.]

REVEREND TRAVIS
In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body that may be like unto his glorious body according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself. Amen.

ALL
Amen.

LADY MARY
Would you give him a moment?

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
Of course not, I understand.

[The mourners leave except Matthew. Mary approaches him by Lavinia's grave. Anna Bates, Mrs Hughes, Mr Carson, and Mr Bates walk back to the house.]

MRS HUGHES
We better get moving if we're to be back there before they arrive.

ANNA
Mrs Patmore and Thomas will go ahead in the trap. They'll sort it out between them.

MRS HUGHES
Mm, I've no doubt Thomas will have everything sorted out.

[Mrs Hughes gives Carson a significant look.]

MR CARSON
I'm sorry Mrs Hughes, but it's no good thinking that we'll get shot of him now.

Why doesn't that come as a surprise?

[Daisy sees Matthew standing at William's grave as she walks back. He sees her and she goes to him.]

MR MASON
I've been hoping I might meet you here one day. I expect you come as often as I try to do.

DAISY MASON
It was a funeral...of a lady that was going to marry Mr Crawley.

MR MASON
I heard about that. There's nothing so wrong as when young folks die.

[Daisy wipes her eyes.]

MR MASON
Hey, needn't hide your tears from me, love.

[He hands her a handkerchief.]

MR MASON
It does me good to see how much you loved him. It does.

[Back at Lavinia's grave.]

LADY MARY
You must tell me if there's anything I can do. Anything at all.

MATTHEW
Thank you, but I don't think so.

[Mary nods and turns to go.]

MATTHEW
That night when we were dancing and Lavinia came downstairs...she heard. She...she saw...everything.

LADY MARY
How terrible for her. I'm so sorry.

MATTHEW
Because of what she saw, she thought we should cancel the wedding. That I belonged with you, not with her. She gave up because of us. She said to me when she was dying, "Isn't this better?" I know it's a cliché, but...I believe she died of a broken heart, because of that kiss. And we were the ones who killed her.

LADY MARY
Oh, Matthew.

MATTHEW
We could never be happy now, don't you see? We are cursed, you and I. And there's nothing to be done about it. Let's be strong, Mary. And let's accept...that this is the end.

LADY MARY
Of course it's the end. How could it not be?

[Carlisle walks up.]

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
I'm so very sorry about this.

MATTHEW
Thank you.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
Can I walk you up to the house or, er...?

LADY MARY
Certainly you can. I want you to.

[Mary and Carlisle walk arm in arm back to the house, Mary just as upset as Matthew. Robert and Violet visit with Dr Clarkson and Reverend Travis. Robert looks over to see Branson talking to Sybil and goes to them.]

LADY SYBIL
It's so sad.

BRANSON
Yes.

ROBERT
Why are you here ?

BRANSON
To pay my respects to Miss Swire, and to see Sybil.

ROBERT
Lady Sybil.

LADY SYBIL
Oh, Papa, what's the point in all that nonsense?

ROBERT
I suppose you'll go to Dublin now. Isn't that your plan?

LADY SYBIL
In a day or two. Mama is well again and I see no reason to delay. Although, I do so wish we could have parted friends.

ROBERT
What about you? Do you want to "part friends"?

BRANSON
I do. Although, I don't expect to.

[Branson and Sybil turn to go.]

ROBERT
All right.

[They stop and turn back around.]

LADY SYBIL
What?

ROBERT
Well, if I can't stop you, I see no profit in a quarrel. You'll have a very different life from the one you might have lived, but if you're sure it's what you want.

[Sybil looks at Branson with a smile.]

LADY SYBIL
I am.

ROBERT
Then you may take my blessing with you, whatever that means.

LADY SYBIL
Oh, Papa. It means more than anything!

[She hugs him with delight.]

LADY SYBIL
More than anything!

ROBERT
If you mistreat her, I will personally have you torn to pieces by wild dogs.

BRANSON
I'd expect no less.

LADY SYBIL
Will you come over for the wedding?

ROBERT
We'll see. We'll talk about that later. And there'll be some money. But not much.

[Sybil smiles and kisses him on the cheek. Sybil and Branson walk off hand in hand. Violet approaches Robert and they follow.]

VIOLET
So, you've given in?

ROBERT
She would've gone anyway.

[Violet makes a noise at that.]

ROBERT
And perhaps we should let Lavinia's last gift to us be a reminder of what really matters. Of course, you'll think that's soft.

VIOLET
Well, not at all. The aristocracy has not survived by its intransigence. Oh, no, no, we must work with what we've got to minimize the scandal.

ROBERT
But what have we got to work with?

VIOLET
Well, you'd be surprised. He's political, isn't he? And a writer. Well, I could make something out of that. And there's a family called Branson with a place not far from Cork. I believe they have a connection with the Howards. Well, surely, we can hitch him onto them.

--
[01:05:40, INT. SERVANTS' CORRIDOR - DAY]
[The servants arrive home from the funeral. Mrs Patmore comes out of the kitchen when she sees them.]

MRS PATMORE
Mr Bates.

MR BATES
Are you all right, Mrs Patmore?

MRS PATMORE
I'm all right. There are two men waiting for you in the servants' hall.

[Mrs Patmore looks worried. Bates and Anna walk to the servants' hall. Mrs Hughes and Carson see the men and turn back to watch Mr Bates enter.]

MR BATES
Are you looking for me?

POLICEMAN
John Bates?

MR BATES
Yes.

POLICEMAN
You are under arrest on the charge of wilful murder. You are not obliged to say anything unless you desire to do so. Whatever you say will be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence against you upon your trial.

MR BATES
I understand.

[The other policeman takes Bates's wrist.]

ANNA BATES
No. No--

MR BATES
Please...do whatever is required.

[The policeman cuffs Bates.]

MR BATES
I love you.

MRS BATES
And I love you. For richer, for poorer, for better, for worse.

[Anna kisses him.]

POLICEMAN
Come along, sir.

[They lead Bates down the corridor, past all of the servants. Anna Bates stands in the servants hall watching after them, lip trembling.]
