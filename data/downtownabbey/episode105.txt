[00:29, INT. LADY MARY'S BEDROOM - MORNING]

ANNA
You made me jump.

GWEN
Daisy, what is the matter with you? You’re all thumbs.

DAISY
Sorry. I hate this room.

GWEN
Well, why? What’s the matter with it?

ANNA
Daisy?

--
[01:18, INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING]

LADY MARY
Who’s that from, Papa? You seem very absorbed.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Your Aunt Rosamund.

LADY EDITH
Anything interesting?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Nothing to trouble you with.

LADY SYBIL
Poor Aunt Rosamund, all alone in that big house. I feel so sorry for her.

LADY MARY
I don’t. All alone with plenty of money and a house in Eton Square? I can’t imagine anything better.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Really, Mary, I wish you wouldn’t talk like that. There will come a day when someone thinks you mean what you say.

LADY MARY
It can’t come soon enough for me.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Carson, I’ll be in the library. Will you let me know when Her Ladyship is down?

MR CARSON
Certainly, my lord.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Sybil, darling, this one’s for you.

--
[02:04, INT. CORRIDOR/LADY SYBIL'S BEDROOM - MORNING]

LADY SYBIL
I saw another opening for a secretary and I applied.

GWEN
But you never said.

LADY SYBIL
I didn’t want you to be disappointed.

GWEN
I thought you’d given up.

LADY SYBIL
I’ll never give up, and nor will you. Things are changing for women, Gwen. Not just the vote, but our lives.

GWEN
But it’s tomorrow at ten o’clock. Last time, we waited for weeks and weeks and—and this one’s tomorrow.

LADY SYBIL
Then we must be ready by tomorrow, mustn’t we?

--
[02:31, INT. CRAWLEY HOUSE]

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
I thought I’d write to Edith to settle our promised church visit.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
If you want.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Well, we can’t just throw her over when she made such an effort to arrange the last one.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
It’s all in your head.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
I don’t think so.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Then...she’s barking up the wrong tree.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Poor Edith, I hope there’s a right tree for her somewhere.

MR MOLESLEY
Ma’am, I was wondering if I might take some time this afternoon to help in the village hall.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Why? What’s happening?

MR MOLESLEY
It’s the flower show, sir, next Saturday. I’ll give my father a hand with his stall if I may.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Of course you must go.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
And so, I’m afraid, must I.

--
[03:03, INT. STOREROOM - DAY]

MR BATES
Is Mr Carson about?

THOMAS
I don’t think so. I was just looking for him myself.

--
[03:25, EXT. DOWNTON ABBEY, GROUNDS - DAY]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Busy?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I’m just trying to sort out the wretched flower show.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I’ve had a letter from Rosamund.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Don’t tell me, she wants a saddle of lamb and all the fruit and vegetables we can muster.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
She enjoys a taste of her old home.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM (chuckles)
She enjoys not paying for food.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
But there’s something else. Apparently, the word is going ‘round London that Evelyn Napier has given up any thought of Mary, that he’s going to marry one of the Sempill girls. She writes as if somehow it reflects badly on Mary.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Your dear sister’s always such a harbinger of joy.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
No, as if...as if Mary had somehow been found wanting in her character.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Well, I don’t believe Mr Napier would have said that.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Neither do I, really, but—

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
She ought to be married. Talk to her.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM (chuckles)
She never listens to me. If she did, she’d marry Matthew.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
What about Anthony Strallan?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Anthony Strallan is at least my age and as dull as paint. I doubt she’d want to sit next to him at dinner, let alone marry him.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
She has to marry someone, Robert. And if this is what’s being said in London, she has to marry soon.

--
[04:37, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - DAY]

MISS O’BRIEN
You shouldn’t do that in here.

WILLIAM
I don’t like being in the pantry all alone. Mr Carson won’t mind. He’s gone into the village.

THOMAS
He’ll mind if I tell him.

DAISY
That’s ridiculous.

MISS O’BRIEN
Do you think so? She wants it put onto a new shirt, but it’s a bit old fashioned to my taste.

DAISY
Oh, no, it’s lovely.

ANNA
Have you recovered, Daisy?

MR BATES
What from?

ANNA
She had a bit of a turn when we were in Lady Mary’s room, didn’t you?

DAISY
I’m fine, thank you.

THOMAS
What sort of a turn? Did you see a ghost?

WILLIAM
Will you leave her alone if she doesn’t want to talk about it?

THOMAS
I’ve often wondered if this place is haunted. It ought to be.

MISS O’BRIEN
Of the spirits of maids and footmen who died in slavery?

MR BATES
But not, in Thomas’s case, from overwork.

THOMAS
Come on, Daisy, what was it?

DAISY
I don’t know. I was thinking, first we had the Titanic--

MISS O’BRIEN
Don’t keep harping back to that.

DAISY
I know it was a while ago, but we knew him. I think of how we laid the fires for Mr Patrick, but he drowned in them icy waters.

MISS O’BRIEN
For God’s sake.

DAISY
And then there’s the Turkish gentleman. It just seems there’s been too much death in the house.

WILLIAM
What’s that got to do with Lady Mary’s bedroom?

DAISY
Nothing. Nothing at all.

--
[06:02, INT. VILLAGE HALL - DAY]

MR MOLESLEY
Afternoon, ma’am.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
When do you put that magnificent display of prizes on show?

MR MOLESLEY
Not till the day itself.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
I remember a superb cup from last year.

MR MOLESLEY
The Grantham Cup. It was donated by the late Lord Grantham for the best bloom in the village.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
And who won it?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I did.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Well done. And the year before?

MR MOLESLEY
Her Ladyship won that one, too.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Heaven’s, how thrilling. And before that?

MR MOLESLEY
You’ve met my father.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Good afternoon, Mr Molesley. What are you showing this year?

MR WILLIAM MOLESLEY
Oh, this and that.

MR MOLESLEY
Only the finest roses in the village.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Really? What an achievement.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
It’s a wonderful area for roses. We’re very lucky. We’ll see some beautiful examples right across the show, won’t we, Mr Molesley?

MR WILLIAM MOLESLEY
If you say so, Your Ladyship.

--
[07:14, INT. CORRIDOR/SERVANTS' STAIRCASE - DAY]

MISS O’BRIEN
What’s up with you?

THOMAS
Nothing.

MISS O’BRIEN
His Lordship’s blaming Mr Napier for spreading gossip about Lady Mary, but it was you, wasn’t it?

THOMAS
Why do you say that?

MISS O’BRIEN
Because Napier wasn’t in on it. Only four people knew he was in her room that night. You, me, Lady Mary, and possibly Daisy, and I haven’t said nothing to nobody.

THOMAS
Well, I didn’t tell about Pamuk, I just wrote that Lady Mary was no better than she ought to be.

MISS O’BRIEN
Who did you write it to?

THOMAS
Only a friend of mine, valet to Lord Savident.

MISS O’BRIEN
You know what they say about Old Savident. “Not so much an open mind as an open mouth.” No wonder it’s all ‘round London.

THOMAS
You won’t tell, will you? I’m in enough trouble as it is.

MISS O’BRIEN
Why, what’s happened?

THOMAS
Mr Bates saw me nicking a bottle of wine.

MISS O’BRIEN
Has he told Mr Carson?

THOMAS
Not yet, but he will when he’s feeling spiteful. I wish we could be shot of him.

MISS O’BRIEN
Then think of something quick. Turn the tables on him before he has a chance to nail you.

--
[08:13, INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I thought you went to bed hours ago.

LADY SYBIL
I was writing a note for Lynch. I need the governess cart tomorrow.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Oh?

LADY SYBIL
I’m going to Moulton.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Oh, don’t risk the traffic in Moulton, not now every Tom, Dick, and Harry seems to have a motor.

LADY SYBIL
Hardly.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Last time I was there, there were five cars parked in the marketplace and another three drove past while I was waiting. Get Branson to take you in the car. Neither of us are using it.

LADY SYBIL
I thought I’d pop in on old Mrs Steward. Will you tell Mama if I forget?

--
[08:43, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - MORNING]

MISS O’BRIEN
You’re late this morning.

DAISY
The library grate needed a real going over. Are any of them down yet?

THOMAS
Lady Sybil’s in the dining room.

DAISY
I’ll start with her room, then.

MISS O’BRIEN
Daisy, you know when you were talking about the feeling of death in the house...

DAISY
I was just being silly.

MISS O’BRIEN
I found myself wondering about the connection between the poor Turkish gentleman, Mr Pamuk, and Lady Mary’s room. Only, you were saying how you felt so uncomfortable in there.

DAISY
Well, I’ve...I’ve got to get on. I’m late enough as it is.

[BREAK 1]

--
ACT TWO

[09:33, EXT. VILLAGE ROAD - DAY]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Hello. Is everything all right?

LADY MARY
Oh, hello. I’m about to send a telegram

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Oh.

LADY MARY
Papa’s sister is always nagging him to send supplies to London, and then we cable her so her butler can be at King’s Cross to meet them. It’s idiotic, really.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Is this Lady Rosamund Painswick?

LADY MARY
You have done your homework.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
She wrote to welcome me into the family, which I thought pretty generous, given the circumstances.

LADY MARY
It’s easy to be generous when you have nothing to lose. So, you doing any more church visiting with Edith?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
My mother’s trying to set something up.

LADY MARY
Well, watch out. I think she has big plans for you.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Then she’s in for an equally big disappointment.

--
[10:24, INT. LADY SYBIL'S BEDROOM - MORNING]

DAISY
Is it all right to do the fire?

ANNA
Why are you so late?

DAISY
I went back to my room after I’d woken everyone and I just shut my eyes for a moment. I’ve been trying to catch up ever since.

ANNA
Have you had any breakfast?

DAISY
Not a crumb.

ANNA
Here.

GWEN
Wait—you can’t take a biscuit.

ANNA
She never eats them. None of them do. Just thrown away and changed every evening.

DAISY
Thanks. She won’t mind anyway. She’s nice, Lady Sybil.

MR CARSON
Gwen? May I ask why you’re sitting on Lady Sybil’s bed?

GWEN
Well, you see, I had a turn - like a burst of sickness - just sudden like. I had to sit down.

ANNA
It’s true.

MR CARSON
You better go and lie down. I’ll tell Mrs Hughes.

GWEN
I don’t need to interrupt her morning. I’m sure I’ll be fine if I could just put my feet up.

MR CARSON
And how many bedrooms have you still got to do?

ANNA
Just one. Lady Edith.

MR CARSON
And you can manage on your own?

ANNA
Well, she’s no use to man or beast in that state. Go on. Shoo.

[Gwen leaves.]

MR CARSON
Daisy, may I ask why you’re holding Lady Sybil’s biscuit jar?

DAISY
Er...I was just polishing it before I put it back.

MR CARSON
See that you do.

--
[11:55, INT. KITCHENS - DAY]

MRS PATMORE
I’m sorry, but I can’t do more than my best.

MRS HUGHES
Is there some difficulty Your Ladyship?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Dear Mrs Hughes, as you know, we’re giving dinner on Friday for Sir Anthony Strallan.

MRS HUGHES
Yes, milady.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Well, it seems he’s particularly fond of a certain new pudding. It’s called Apple Charlotte. Do you know it?

MRS HUGHES
I—I’m not sure.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
His sister, Mrs Chetwood, sent me the receipt. I’m trying to persuade Mrs Patmore to make it.

MRS PATMORE
And I’m trying to persuade Her Ladyship that I have already planned the dinner with her, and I can’t change it now.

MRS HUGHES
Why not?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Because everything’s been ordered and prepared.

MRS HUGHES
Well, there’s nothing here that looks very complicated. Apples, lemons, butter...

MRS PATMORE
I cannot work from a new receipt at a moment’s notice!

DAISY
But I can read it to you, if that’s the problem.

MRS PATMORE
Problem? Who mentioned a problem? How dare you say such a thing in front of Her Ladyship?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Very well. We’ll try it another time when you’ve had longer to prepare. We’ll stay with the raspberry meringue.

MRS HUGHES
And very nice it’ll be, too.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I’m sure.

MRS PATMORE
Have you taken leave of your senses?

MRS HUGHES
I’m so sorry about that, milady.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Never mind. I was asking a lot. Do look after that girl.

MRS HUGHES
Daisy? She’s used to it. She’ll be all right.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I wonder. Mrs Patmore looks ready to eat her alive.

DAISY
I was only try to help.

MRS PATMORE
Oh! Judas was only trying to help, I suppose, when he brought the Roman soldiers to the garden!

--
[13:19, EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY]

GWEN
Well, I had to let the skirt down a little, but I can put it back.

LADY SYBIL
No, it’s yours. What will happen if one of the maids finds your room is empty?

GWEN
Oh, it would only be Anna, and she wouldn’t give me away. She’s like a sister. She’d never betray me.

LADY SYBIL
Oh, well, then she’s not like my sisters. Walk on.

--
[13:56, LADY EDITH'S BEDROOM - MORNING]

MR BATES
Shall I give you a hand?

ANNA
Oh, would you? It takes half the time with two.

MR BATES
I always feel a bit sorry for Lady Edith.

ANNA
Me, too. Although I don’t know why, when you think what she’s got and what we haven’t.

MR BATES
Mrs Hughes said she was after the other heir, Mr Patrick Crawley, the one who drowned.

ANNA
That was different. She was in love with him.

MR BATES
What happened?

ANNA
She never got her luck in. He was always set up to marry Lady Mary.

MR BATES
Then he’s a braver man than I am, Gunga Din. Sad to think about.

ANNA
It’s always sad when you love someone who doesn’t love you back, no matter who you are.

MR BATES
No, I mean, it’s sad that he died.

ANNA
Oh. Yes. Very sad. He was nice. Well, thank you for that. Much appreciated.

MR BATES
My pleasure. Perhaps Mr Patrick did love her back, he just couldn’t say it.

ANNA
Why ever not?

MR BATES
Sometimes we’re not at liberty to speak. Sometimes it wouldn’t be right.

--
[15:21, INT. OFFICE BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY]

SECRETARY
Take a seat.

--
[15:52, INT. THE DOWER HOUSE - DAY]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
The flower show? Oh, I thought I was in for another telling off about the hospital.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
No, this time it’s the flower show. I’ve been to see old Mr Molesley’s garden and his roses are the most beautiful I’ve ever laid eyes on.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Go on.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
You may not know it, but I believe the committee feel obliged to give you the cup for the best bloom as a kind of local tradition.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
No, no, I d—I do not know that. I thought I usually won the prize for best bloom in the village because my garden had grown the best bloom in the village.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Yes. But you don’t usually win, do you? You always win.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Yes. I have been very fortunate in that regard.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
But surely, when Mr Molesley’s garden is so remarkable, and he’s so very proud of his roses—

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
You talk of Mr Molesley’s pride? What about my gardener’s pride? Is he to be sacrificed on the altar of Molesley’s ambition?

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
All I’m asking is that you release them from any obligation to let you win. Why not just tell them to choose whichever flower is best?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
But that is precisely what they already know...and do.

--
[17:07, INT. OFFICE BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY]
[Gwen exits the office and nervously rushes down the hallway.]

--
[17:16, INT. LORD GRANTHAM'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY]

MR BATES
I’m sorry, my lord, I didn’t think you’d be in here.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Are my eyes deceiving me, or is one of these missing?

MR BATES
I don’t know them well enough.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
No, why would you? There’s a very pretty little blue one with a miniature framed in French paste. It was made for a German prince, I forget who. Unless it’s been moved for some reason...but why would it be?

--
[17:54, EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY]

LADY SYBIL
Can you help? I should be so grateful. Our horse has cast his shoe. Is there a smithy nearby?

STRANGER
Ah, you can try old Crump in the next village.

LADY SYBIL
Thank you.

GWEN
Thank you.

LADY SYBIL
See? Help is at hand. And at least it happened on the way home.

GWEN
They’ll all be worried about you, and if they check on me, I’m finished.

--
[18:12, INT. SERVANTS' CORRIDOR - DAY]

ANNA
Is Her Ladyship wearing that now?

MISS O’BRIEN
Oh, no, this is for Friday night. I just thought I’d give it a press while I had the time.

ANNA
You don’t know what’s happened to Lady Sybil, do you? I’ve got the changes ready for the other two, but there’s no sign of her.

MISS O’BRIEN
Don’t you start. I’ve had Her Majesty on at me all afternoon.

WILLIAM
Mr Carson says he’ll fetch the police if she’s not back soon.

--
[18:31, EXT. SMITHY - DAY]

STRANGER 2
Sorry, Miss, but Mr Crump’s staying over at the Skelton estates tonight. He’s working there all week.

LADY SYBIL (sigh)
Is there anyone else?

STRANGER 2
Not that I know of.

--
[18:48, EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY]

LADY SYBIL
Come on, Dragon! Come on! Dragon, if you don’t move now, I’ll have you boiled for glue!

--
[19:05, INT. LADY GRANTHAM'S BEDROOM - EVENING]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
What if she’s over turned? What if she’s lying in a ditch somewhere?

MISS O’BRIEN
I’m sure she’ll be back in the shake of a lamb’s tail.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
The truth is, they’re all getting too old for a mother’s control.

MISS O’BRIEN
They’re growing up.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
They’ve grown up. They need their own establishments.

MISS O’BRIEN
I’m sure they’ll all get plenty of offers.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
No one ever warns you about bringing up daughters. You think it’s going to be like Little Women. Instead, they’re at each other’s throats from dawn till dusk.

--
[19:36, INT. HOUSEMAIDS' BEDROOM - EVENING]

ANNA
You look done in. I’ll bring you some food up later when we’ve finished dinner. Where were you?

GWEN
You came up, then?

ANNA
‘Course I did. Had to change for the afternoon.

GWEN
Did you cover for me?

ANNA
What do you think? I don’t suppose this had anything to do with Lady Sybil?

GWEN
Oh, Anna, it was a nightmare. I don’t know how I got in without being seen. I’m sure I left a trail of mud up the stairs.

ANNA
So...did you get the job?

GWEN
Well, we’ll have to wait and see.

--
[20:24, INT. LIBRARY - EVENING]

MISS O’BRIEN
Sorry to bother you, milady, but your mother wanted you to know Lady Sybil’s back. She’s changing now, so dinner won’t be late after all.

LADY EDITH
What happened to her?

MISS O’BRIEN
The horse went lame.

LADY EDITH
Is there anything else?

MISS O’BRIEN
There is something that’s been troubling me. Do you remember the Turkish gentleman, Mr Pamuk, the one who died all of a sudden like?

LADY EDITH
Of course I remember.

MISS O’BRIEN
Well, it’s Daisy, my lady...the kitchen maid. Only, she’s been talking recently as if she had ideas about Mr Pamuk’s death.

LADY EDITH
What sort of ideas?

MISS O’BRIEN
Well, I’ve no proof, and maybe I’m wrong, but I’ve a sense she knows something but won’t say what. Something involving Lady Mary.

LADY EDITH
Well, how absurd. Well, what could she know?

MISS O’BRIEN
Whatever it is, she won’t say. Not to us, anyway.

LADY EDITH
Have you spoken to Lady Mary about this?

MISS O’BRIEN
I didn’t like to, milady. It seemed impertinent somehow, but I thought someone in the family ought to know about it.

LADY EDITH
Quite right. Bring the girl to my room...tomorrow after breakfast.

LADY MARY
What did she want?

LADY EDITH
Nothing. Just a message from Mama to say that Sybil had turned up alive.

LADY MARY
Poor darling. She had to walk for miles. I don’t think I’d have got down however lame the horse.

LADY EDITH
No. I don’t believe you would.

[BREAK 2]

--
ACT THREE
[22:22, INT. LADY EDITH'S BEDROOM - MORNING]

DAISY
I couldn’t say, milady. I don’t know what Miss O’Brien means. I didn’t see nothing...not much.

LADY EDITH
O’Brien, I wonder if you might leave us.

[O’Brien leaves.]

LADY EDITH
Now, it’s Daisy, isn’t it?

DAISY
Yes, milady.

LADY EDITH
I’m sure you see O’Brien only acted as she did because she is concerned.

DAISY
I suppose so, milady.

LADY EDITH
She seems to think that you are in possession of some knowledge that is uncomfortable for you. Because, if that is the case, then I don’t think it fair on you. Why should you be burdened with Mary’s secret? Oh, my dear, my heart goes out to you, it really does. Oh, there, there. You’ve been carrying too heavy a burden for too long. Just tell me and I promise you’ll feel better.

--
[23:50, INT. VILLAGE HALL - DAY]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
You seem well prepared.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
We’ll add a few more flowers before we open in the morning, but I think we’re nearly there.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Do look at Mr Molesley’s display. He’s worked so hard.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Rather marvellous, aren’t they?

LADY MARY
Lovely. Well done, Mr Molesley.

MR WILLIAM MOLESLEY
Thank you, milady.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I think everyone is to be congratulated. Splendid.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
But do look at these roses. Have you ever seen the like?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
My dear Mrs Crawley believes I’m profiting from an unfair advantage.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Oh?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Mm. She feels, in the past, I’ve been given the cup merely as a matter of routine rather than merit.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
That’s rather ungallant, Mother. I’m sure when we see Cousin Violet’s roses, it’ll be hard to think they could be bettered.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Hard, but not impossible.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
You are quite wonderful the way you see room for improvement wherever you look. I never knew such reforming as you.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
I take that as a compliment.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I must’ve said it wrong.

[Violet chuckles.]

LADY MARY
Poor Granny, she’s not used to being challenged.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Nor is Mother. I think we should let them settle it between them.

LADY MARY
So, are you interested in flowers?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I’m interested in the village. In fact, I’m on my way to inspect the cottages.

LADY MARY
You know what all work and no play did for Jack.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
You think I’m a dull boy anyway, don’t you? I play, too. I’m coming up for dinner tonight. I suspect I’m there to balance the numbers. Is it in aid of anything?

LADY MARY
Not that I know of. Just a couple of dreary neighbours, that’s all.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Maybe I’ll shine by comparison.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Mary, we’re going.

LADY MARY
Maybe you will.

--
[25:46, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - EVENING]

MR CARSON
Might I have a word? I want to say something before I ring the gong. I’m afraid it’s not very pleasant. His Lordship is missing a very valuable snuff box. It appears to have been taken from the case in his room. If one of you knows anything about this, will he or she please come to me? Your words will be heard in the strictest confidence. Thank you.

MISS O’BRIEN
I am sorry, Mr Bates. What an unpleasant thing to have happened.

ANNA
Why are you picking on him?

THOMAS
Because he’s the only one of us who goes in there. But don’t worry, I’m sure it’ll turn up.

MR BATES
Thank you for your concern.

[The dinner gong rings.]

MR BATES
I hate this kind of thing. I hope to God they find it. Better get a move on.

--
[27:00, INT. LADY MARY'S BEDROOM - EVENING]
[Someone knocks on the door.]

LADY MARY
I’m coming.

[Cora enters.]

LADY MARY
Does this broach work? I can’t decide.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
It’s charming.

LADY MARY
Oh, dear, is it another scolding?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Of course not. You’re too grown up to scold these days.

LADY MARY
Heavens, then it’s really serious.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I’d like you to look after Sir Anthony Strallan tonight. He’s a nice, decent man. His position may not be quite like Papa’s, but it would still make you a force for good in the county.

LADY MARY
Mama, not again. How many times am I to be ordered to marry the man sitting next to me at dinner?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
As many times as it takes.

LADY MARY
I turned down Matthew Crawley, is it likely I’d marry Strallan when I wouldn’t marry him?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I’m glad you’ve come to think more highly of Cousin Matthew.

LADY MARY
That’s not the point.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
No. The point is, when you refused Matthew, you were the daughter of an earl with an unsullied reputation. Now you are damaged goods.

LADY MARY
Mama.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Somehow, I don’t know how, there’s a rumour in London that you are not virtuous.

LADY MARY
What? Does Papa know about this?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
He knows it and he dismisses it because, unlike you and me, he does not know that it is true. Let’s hope it’s just unkind gossip. Because if anyone heard about...

LADY MARY
Kemal? My lover. Kemal Pamuk.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Exactly. If it gets around and you’re not already married, every door in London will be slammed in your face.

LADY MARY
Mama, the world is changing.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Not that much. And not fast enough for you.

LADY MARY
I know you mean to help. I know you love me. But I also know what I’m capable of, and forty years of boredom and duty just isn’t possible for me. I’m sorry.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I do love you. And I want to help.

LADY MARY
I’m a lost cause, Mama. Leave me to manage my own affairs. Why not concentrate on Edith? She needs all the help she can get.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
You mustn’t be unkind to Edith. She has fewer advantages than you.

LADY MARY
Fewer? She has none at all.

[29:37, INT. KITCHENS - EVENING]

MRS PATMORE
Open the oven.

ANNA
What’s happened?

MRS PATMORE
It's that bloomin' Daisy! I said she’d be the death of me, now my words come true!

DAISY
I didn’t do nothing!

ANNA
Come and sit down.

[A cat starts to eat the chicken and Gwen rushes forward.]

GWEN
Get away! Get back to the stables!

[Gwen shoos the cat away.]

GWEN
Well, what will you serve now?

MRS PATMORE
Them, of course, I haven’t got anything else.

ANNA
Daisy, give us a hand. Get that cloth. What’s the matter with that?

DAISY
Are you sure? Shouldn’t we tell?

MRS PATMORE
Certainly not!

THOMAS
Is the remove ready to go up?

ANNA
Here we are. Daisy, give him a hand with the vegetables. They’re up in the serve room in the warmer.

GWEN
I’m glad I don’t have to eat them.

MRS PATMORE
What they eye can’t see, the heart won’t grieve over.

--
[30:27, INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING]

SIR ANTHONY STRALLAN
Mm, there’s no doubt about it. The next few years in farming are going to be about mechanisation. That’s the test, and we’re going to have to meet it. Don’t you agree, Lady Mary?

LADY MARY
Yes, of course, Sir Anthony. I’m sure I do. (aside) Are we ever going to be allowed to turn?

LADY EDITH
Sir Anthony, it must be so hard to meet the challenge of the future and yet be fair to your employees.

SIR ANTHONY STRALLAN
That is the point precisely. We can’t fight progress, but we must find ways to soften the blow.

LADY EDITH
I should love to see one of the new harvesters, if you would ever let me. We don’t have one here.

SIR ANTHONY STRALLAN
I should be delighted.

--
[31:20, INT. KITCHENS - EVENING]

WILLIAM
I hope they find that snuff box. What happens if they don’t?

THOMAS
They’ll organise a search, won’t they? I wouldn’t be Mr Bates. Not for all the tea in china.

ANNA
Wouldn’t you, Thomas? I daresay he feels just the same about you. What’s the matter with you?

MISS O’BRIEN
Nothing.

MRS PATMORE
Oh, just a minute. I don’t like to put it on earlier. It sinks in and spoils the effect.

--
[31:52, INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING]

SIR ANTHONY STRALLAN
Lady Grantham.

LADY MARY
Mama has released me, thank God.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Sir Anthony seems nice enough.

LADY MARY
If you want to talk farming and foxes by the hour.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I’m rather looking forward to the flower show tomorrow.

LADY MARY
Mm. Where Mr Molesley’s roses will turn everybody’s heads. But if you tell Granny I said so, I’ll denounce you as a liar.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I wouldn’t dare. I’ll leave that to my fearless mother.

[They chuckle.]

LADY MARY
How were the cottages?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
They’re coming on wonderfully. I’d love to show you.

SIR ANTHONY STRALLAN
Obviously it’s an act of faith at this stage.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Hm, yes.

SIR ANTHONY STRALLAN
Oh, Go--God!

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
What on earth?

SIR ANTHONY STRALLAN
I do apologise, Lady Grantham, but I had a mouthful of salt.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
What?

[Cora tastes the dessert.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Everyone, put down your forks. Carson, remove this. Bring fruit. Bring cheese. Bring anything to take this taste away. Sir Anthony, I am so sorry.

[Matthew and Mary giggle behind their napkins.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Fains I be Mrs Patmore’s kitchen maid when the news gets out.

LADY SYBIL
Poor girl. We ought to send in a rescue party.

LADY EDITH
You must think us very disorganised.

SIR ANTHONY STRALLAN
Not at all. These things happen.

[Mary and Matthew continue chuckling.]

--
[33:07, INT. KITCHENS - EVENING]
[Mrs Patmore sobs.]

ANNA
Hey, come on. It’s not that bad. Nobody’s died.

MRS PATMORE
I don’t understand it. It must’ve been that Daisy. She’s muddled everything up before.

DAISY
But I never--

MR CARSON
Don’t worry, Daisy, you’re not in the line of fire here.

MRS PATMORE
I know that pudding. I chose it ‘cause I knew it.

MRS HUGHES
Which is why you wouldn’t let Her Ladyship have the pudding she wanted because you didn’t know it.

MRS PATMORE
Exactly. I don’t see how it happened.

MR BATES
Come on, everyone. Let’s give Mrs Patmore some room to breathe. You, too.

ANNA
I don’t think I should leave her.

MR BATES
Yes, you should. Mr Carson knows what he’s doing.

MRS PATMORE
Oh, don’t do that. Get William or the hall boy to do it, it’s beneath your dignity.

MR CARSON
It won’t kill me. Now, all in your own good time. I think you’ve got something to tell me, haven’t you?

[BREAK 3]

--
ACT FOUR
[34:21, INT. SERVANTS' CORRIDOR - EVENING]

ANNA
I think I know where that snuff box is.

MR BATES
Where?

ANNA
Hidden in your room.

MR BATES
You don’t think—

ANNA
‘Course I don’t, silly beggar.

MR BATES
Then--

ANNA
I bet Thomas’d like it if they took you for a thief.

MR BATES
Yes, I expect he would.

ANNA
Go upstairs now and find it. And when you have, you can choose whether to put it in Thomas’s room or give it to me, and I’ll slip it into Miss O’Brien’s.

MR BATES
You naughty girl.

ANNA
“Fight fire with fire,” that’s what my mum says.

--
[34:56, INT. DRAWING ROOM - EVENING]

LADY SYBIL
Poor Mrs Patmore. Do you think you should go down and see her?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Tomorrow. She needs time to recover her nerves. I knew there was something going on.

LADY EDITH
It seems hard that poor Sir Anthony had to pay the price.

LADY MARY
Good God!

[They burst out laughing.]

LADY EDITH
As for you giggling like a ridiculous schoolgirl with Cousin Matthew...it was pathetic.

LADY MARY
Oh, poor Edith. I’m sorry Cousin Matthew’s proved a disappointment to you.

LADY EDITH
Who says he has.

LADY MARY
Matthew? He told me. Oh, sorry, wasn’t I supposed to know?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
You were very helpful, Edith, looking after Sir Anthony. You saved the day.

LADY EDITH
I enjoyed it. We seem to have a lot to talk about.

LADY MARY
Spare me your boasting, please.

LADY EDITH
Now who’s jealous?

LADY MARY
Jealous? Do you think I couldn’t have that old booby if I wanted him?

LADY EDITH
Even you can’t take every prize.

LADY MARY
Is that a challenge?

LADY EDITH
If you like.

LADY MARY

--
[36:10, INT. KITCHENS - EVENING]

MRS PATMORE
I could almost manage. For a long time knowing the kitchen and where everything was kept, even with that fool girl.

MR CARSON
I think you might owe Daisy an apology.

MRS PATMORE
Maybe. I had a lot to put up with, I can tell you.

MR CARSON
And you’ve not been to a doctor?

MRS PATMORE
I don’t need a doctor to tell me I--I’m going blind. A blind cook, Mr Carson. What a joke. Whoever heard of such a thing? A blind cook.

--
[36:53, INT. GREAT HALL - EVENING]
[The men exit the dining room.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I hope our salty pudding didn’t spoil the evening for you.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
On the contrary.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I’m glad you and Mary are getting along. There’s no reason you can’t be friends.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
No reason at all.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I don’t suppose there’s any chance that you could sort of...start again?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Life is full of surprises.

--
[37:10, INT. DRAWING ROOM - EVENING]

LADY MARY
Ah, I’ve been waiting for you. I found a book over here and I think it’s just the thing to catch your interest.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Oh, really?

SIR ANTHONY STRALLAN
I’m intrigued. What is it to be?

LADY MARY
Well, I was looking in the library and...

LADY EDITH
I was very taken by what you were saying over dinner about--

SIR ANTHONY STRALLAN
You’re right, Lady Mary. How clever you are. This is exactly what we have to be aware of.

LADY SYBIL
Everyone in London is wearing them.

LADY MARY
There’s a section just here that I was rather unsure about. I wonder if you could tell me...

LADY EDITH
It seems we’ve both been thrown over for a bigger prize.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Heavens, is that the time?

LADY EDITH
You’re not going?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
The truth is, my head’s splitting. I don’t want to spoil the party, so I’ll slip away. Would you make my excuses to your parents?

[Matthew leaves.]

LADY MARY
Excuse me, Sir Anthony.

[Mary goes after Matthew.]

LADY MARY
Has Mr Crawley left?

WILLIAM
Yes, milady.

LADY MARY
But what about the car? Branson can’t have brought it ‘round so quickly.

WILLIAM
Well, he said he’d rather walk, milady.

LADY MARY
Thank you.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Mary can be such a child.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
What do you mean, darling?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
She thinks, if you put a toy down, it will still be sitting there when you want to play with it again.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
What are you talking about?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Never mind.

--
[38:47, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - EVENING]

ANNA
Mr Carson? We were wondering about that snuff box. Has it turned up yet?

MR CARSON
I’m afraid not.

MR BATES
Well, I think we should have a search.

THOMAS
What?

MR BATES
Doesn’t do to leave these things too long.

ANNA
Mr Carson can search the men’s rooms, Mrs Hughes the women’s. And it should be right away, now we’ve talked of it so no one has a chance to hide the box. Don’t you agree, Mr Carson?

MR CARSON
Well, perhaps it’s for the best. Although, I’m sure I won’t find anything. I’ll fetch Mrs Hughes.

THOMAS
I think I’ll just, erm...

MISS O’BRIEN
I better check it’s time.

[O’Brien and Thomas rush out.]

THOMAS
The bastard’s hidden it in my room or yours.

MISS O’BRIEN
Why did I ever listen to you in the first place?

MRS HUGHES
Miss O’Brien? My, my, you have been busy.

--
[39:50, INT. CRAWLEY HOUSE - EVENING]

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
I was expecting you later than this. I’ll tell Molesley to lock up.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Thanks. Goodnight, Mother.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
How was your evening? Did you enjoy yourself?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Quite. The thing is, just for a moment, I thought... Never mind what I thought. I was wrong. Goodnight.

--
[40:24, INT. VILLAGE HALL - DAY]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
My Word, Molesley, splendid roses, as usual. Well done.

MR WILLIAM MOLESLEY
Thank you, Your Lordship.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
All stalls are set out very well this year.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
This is enchanting. Do we grow this?

MR WILLIAM MOLESLEY
I doubt if you got that one, Your Ladyship. I’ve only just found it myself.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Is it a secret, or could you tell Mr Brocket?

MR WILLIAM MOLESLEY
I’d be glad to, milady.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
He should come and see the rose garden. He could give us some ideas.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Old Molesley’s a champion. Or he would be in a fairer world.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Don’t you start.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
I’m afraid I’ve been annoying Cousin Violet on that score.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
If Molesley deserves first prize for his flowers, the judges will give it to him.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
They wouldn’t dare.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Really, Robert, you make me so annoyed. Isn’t it possible I should win the thing on merit?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I think the appropriate answer to that, Mama, is, “Yes, dear.”

--
[41:19, EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY]

DAISY
It’s nice to get the afternoon off.

MISS O’BRIEN
I don’t know why we’re bothering. We’ll have missed the speeches as it is.

THOMAS
Don’t be such a grouch.

MISS O’BRIEN
I’ll grouch if I want to.

ANNA
You should’ve punished one of them at least.

MR BATES
They know that I know. That’s worth something.

ANNA
What do you think will happen to Mrs Patmore?

MR BATES
She’ll muddle through with Daisy for help. In the long term, we’ll just have to wait for the doctor to give his opinion.

ANNA
I hope there’s something they can do.

MR BATES
I hope so, too. But if there isn’t, I hope they tell her there isn't. Nothing is harder to live with than false hope.

ANNA
I wish you’d just come out with it.

MR BATES
With what?

ANNA
Whatever it is you’re keeping secret.

MR BATES
I can’t.

ANNA
You don’t deny it, then?

MR BATES
No, I don’t deny it. And I don’t deny you’ve a right to ask. But I can’t. I’m not a free man.

ANNA
Are you trying to tell me that you’re married?

MR BATES
I have been married, yes, but that’s not all of it.

ANNA
Because...because I love you, Mr Bates. I know it’s not ladylike to say it, but I’m not a lady, and I don’t pretend to be.

MR BATES
You are a lady to me. And I never knew a finer one.

[A cart drives up.]

STRANGER 3
If you want a lift, I can take one of you, but not more.

MR BATES
One of the women.

ANNA
No, you must go. Then we can all hurry and meet you there.

MR BATES
Yes, all right. Mustn’t slow you down. There’s been too much of that already.

[Bates gets in the cart.]

--
[43:30, INT. VILLAGE HALL - DAY]

LADY SYBIL
Have you recovered from our ordeal?

GWEN
Well, I got a letter this morning. They must’ve written it as soon as I left the office. They are pleased to have met me, but I do not quite fit their requirements. So, it was all for nothing.

LADY SYBIL
I don’t agree.

GWEN
Only a fool doesn’t know when they’ve been beaten.

LADY SYBIL
Then I’m a fool for I’m a long way from being beaten yet.

[Applause.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
And now, for the first three...

LADY MARY
When you ran off last night, I hope you hadn’t thought me rude.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Certainly not, I monopolised you at dinner, I had no right to any more of your time.

LADY MARY
You see, Edith and I had this sort of bet—

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Oh, please, don’t apologise. I had a lovely evening, I’m glad we’re on speaking terms. Now, I should look after my mother.

LADY EDITH
Why was Cousin Matthew in such a hurry to get away?

LADY MARY
Don’t be stupid.

LADY EDITH
I suppose you didn’t want him when he wanted you, and now it’s the other way around. You have to admit, it’s quite funny.

LADY MARY
I’ll admit that if I ever wanted to attract a man, I’d stay clear of those clothes and that hat.

LADY EDITH
You think yourself so superior, don’t you?

LADY MARY
Ugh.

LADY EDITH
And I think she who laughs last laughs longest.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Did that missing box of yours ever turn up?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Oh, It was a fuss about nothing. They must’ve put it back on the wrong shelf when they were dusting. Bates found it this morning.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Next time, have a proper look before you start complaining. I’m sure the servants were frightened half to death.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Mia culpa.

[Applause.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
And now the Grantham Cup for the best bloom in the village. And the Grantham Cup is awarded to...

[Violet reads her own name on the judges’ paper.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Mr William Molesley...for his Comtesse Cabarrus rose.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Bravo! Well done! Bravo!

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Congratulations, Mr Molesley.

MR WILLIAM MOLESLEY
Thank you, milady. Thank you for letting me have it.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
It’s the judges who decide these things, not me. But very well done.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Congratulations, so well deserved.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Bravo, Mama. That must’ve been a real sacrifice.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
And bravely born.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I don’t know what everyone’s on about.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
But I...

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
All is well, my dear. All is well.

[46:37, INT. LADY EDITH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT]
[Edith writes a letter just before bed. It is addressed to His Excellency the Turkish Ambassador, 43 Belgrave Square, London, SW.]
