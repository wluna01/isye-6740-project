ANNA
Should we give them some more space between the beds?

LADY EDITH
Well, we could give them--

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Not much. I'm determined to defend the library as a recreation room.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Where are we to sit?

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
We can screen off the small library

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Is that all?

LADY EDITH
I suppose we--

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Well, we could leave you the boudoir. I wanted to put the intermediaries in there, but we don't have to.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
How kind.

LADY SYBIL
Why will we only have officers? Surely all wounded men need to convalesce.

DR CLARKSON
The hospital is for officers, and the whole idea is to have a complimentary convalescent home.

LADY SYBIL
Of course, but I don't know if we can make that an absolute rule.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
If the world were logical, I would rather agree with you.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Which comes as no surprise.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
You would not, I imagine.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
You imagine right. What these men will need is rest and relaxation. Will that be achieved by mixing ranks and putting everyone on edge?

[Violet exits and Sybil follows her into the hall.]

LADY SYBIL
Granny.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Mm?

LADY SYBIL
Different ranks can relax together, it has been known.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Well, don't look at me, I'm very good at mixing. We always danced the first waltz at the servants' ball, didn't we, Carson?

MR CARSON
If was an honour, my lady.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
It's a lot to ask when people aren't at their best. I'm searching for Lady Mary, Carson. Will you tell her I'm in the library?

[Carson bows and goes in search of her. Isobel passes Edith who's standing in a doorway.]

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Don't loiter, Edith. There's plenty to be done.

LADY EDITH
Of course, but I'm not quite what to--

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Sybil, I want to have a quick word with you.

[Edith is left feeling lost.]

--
[01:56, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - DAY]

ANNA
I'm going down to the village this afternoon if anyone wants anything.

MRS HUGHES
Some stamps would be kind. I'll get you the money.

MR CARSON
I'd like to thank you all for your work this morning.

ETHEL
It's so strange to see the rooms converted into dormitories.

ANNA
But good. It was wrong for our life to chug along as if the war were only happening to other people.

DAISY
How will it be, though? Are we all working for Mrs Crawley now?

O'BRIEN
We are not.

MR CARSON
I'm sure the chain of command will be sorted out soon.

O'BRIEN
Or there'll be blood on the stairs.

MR CARSON
Thank you, Miss O'Brien.

[Lang gets up, obviously distressed in some way.]

--
[02:29, INT. LIBRARY - DAY]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
But what do you think it meant?

LADY MARY
Really, Granny. Lavinia Swire knows Richard Carlisle. So what? One knows lots of people in London.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I don't know many people who'd threaten me behind the laurels.

LADY MARY
Aunt Rosamund said herself she didn't know what to make of it.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I still think it's a peculiar way for a gentleman to speak to a lady.

LADY MARY
At least you think him a gentleman.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
The point is, do you think he's a gentleman?

LADY MARY
I'm not sure it matters much to me.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Well, I'm going up to London to stay with Rosamund for a day or two. I think we'll have Lavinia for tea.

LADY MARY
You sound as if you're going to gobble her up.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM (laughs)
If only we could.

--
[03:08, INT. KITCHENS - DAY]

MRS PATMORE
But where are they going to eat?

MR CARSON
I understand from Mrs Crawley that they'll share the dining room with the officers who are almost well.

MRS PATMORE
So, am I running a cantina?

[Daisy giggles as she reads her letter.]

DAISY
William says he's got time off between the end of his training and going overseas.

MRS HUGHES
He'll be with his father, surely?

DAISY
He's going home first, but he wants to come here for his last night.

MRS HUGHES
You wouldn't mind that, would you, Mr Carson?

MR CARSON
Certainly not. I'd be glad to wish him well on his way. Oh, for you Mr Branson.

[Branson enters and Carson hands him a letter.]

DAISY
Why do you think he's coming here?

MRS PATMORE
To see us all and say goodbye. What's wrong with that?

DAISY
Well, suppose it's something more. Suppose he's got plans.

MRS PATMORE
Well, you have to deal with that when it happens. And mind you deal fair. Now, go and grate that suet before I grow old and die.

--
[03:59, EXT. THE VILLAGE - DAY]
[Anna walks down the street, sees a man by a tree nearby who looks like Bates. She rushes to him, but he has disappeared.]

--
[04:31, INT. DOWNTON ABBEY, WARD - DAY]
[Sybil makes up the hospital beds.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Who'll be in charge?

LADY EDITH
Cousin Isobel thinks it'll be her.

LADY MARY
All know is that she'll drive us mad before the end.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I'm going up to change.

LADY SYBIL
I just want to finish this.

LADY EDITH
Aren't you going to the hospital?

LADY SYBIL
Not yet. I'm on a night shift. I'll walk down after dinner. And please don't start lecturing me.

LADY EDITH
I won't. The truth is, I envy you.

LADY SYBIL
Do you ever miss helping out on the Drakes' farm?

LADY EDITH
That's a funny question. Why?

LADY SYBIL
No reason. It's just, you seemed to have such a purpose there. It suited you.

LADY EDITH
It did suit me. I enjoyed it. But now I feel like a spare part.

LADY SYBIL
Trust me, you have a talent that none of the rest of us have. Just find out what it is and use it. It's doing nothing that's the enemy.

--
[05:30, INT. LADY GRANTHAM'S BEDROOM - DAY]

O'BRIEN
The truth is, milady, Mrs Crawley's forgotten this is your house. And we need a friend in charge of the day-to-day management. Because if Mrs Crawley gets one of her toadies in to run things, she'll have her nose in every pie before you can say Jack Robinson.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
But who?

O'BRIEN
What about Thomas, milady? He's hospital trained, and he's always had a soft spot for Downton.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Thomas? The footman? Managing Downton Abbey?

O'BRIEN
But he's not a footman now, is he? He's a corporal with real battle experience as a medic.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Could Dr Clarkson spare him?

O'BRIEN
Well, I suppose he'll have to spare somebody.

--
[06:11, INT. LADY MARY'S BEDROOM - DAY]
[Anna is learning how to use a curling iron on Mary's hair.]

LADY MARY
Are you all right? You seem a bit preoccupied.

ANNA
I had a...Never mind.

LADY MARY
What?

ANNA
It was this afternoon in the village, I thought I saw Mr Bates.

LADY MARY
Bates? Isn't he in London?

ANNA
I might've been wrong. I walked up to where he was standing and there was no sign of him, but--

LADY MARY
Do you know his address in London?

ANNA
As long as he's still there. Why?

LADY MARY
I'll telephone Sir Richard and ask him to look into it.

ANNA
But what would he know?

LADY MARY
He works in newspapers. A world of spies, tip offs, and private investigators. I promise you, he can find out whatever he likes.

ANNA
All right, then. If you think he can help.

LADY MARY
Good. I'll ring him tonight.

[Mary looks at her curled hair.]

LADY MARY
Not bad. Try to fit in a bit of practice. We've plenty of time to get it right before there's anyone to see me who matters.

--
[07:17, INT. LONDON, BELGRAVE SQUARE, LADY ROSAMUND'S HOUSE - DAY]

LAVINIA
I only know Sir Richard because he is, or was, a friend of my father's, and of my uncle, Jonathan Swire.

LADY ROSAMUND
The liberal minister?

LAVINIA
That's it. But I'm afraid they've fallen out.

LADY ROSAMUND
Aw.

LAVINIA
This room is so pretty. Has the house always been the Painswicks' London home.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
There's no always about the Painswicks, my dear. They were invented from scratch by my son-in-law's grandfather.

LADY ROSAMUND
We bought the house when we were married.

LAVINIA
You make Mr Painswick sound rather a rough diamond, Lady Grantham.

LADY ROSAMUND
Marmaduke wasn't a rough diamond, was he Mama?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
No. He was just cut and polished comparatively recently.

--
[08:01, EXT. DOWNTON GARAGE - DAY]
[Sybil talks to Branson while he washes the car.]

LADY SYBIL
Carson's told Papa you've been called up.

BRANSON
There's no need to look so serious.

LADY SYBIL
You'd think me rather heartless if I didn't.

BRANSON
I'm not going to fight.

LADY SYBIL
You'll have to.

BRANSON
I will not. I'm going to be a conscientious objector.

LADY SYBIL
They'll put you in prison.

BRANSON
I'd rather prison than the Dardanelles.

LADY SYBIL
When will you tell them?

BRANSON
In my own good time.

LADY SYBIL
I don't understand.

BRANSON
I'll go to the medical, I'll report for duty, and when on parade, I'll march out front and I'll shout it loud and clear. And if that doesn't make the newspapers, then I'm a monkey's uncle.

LADY SYBIL
But you'll have a record for the rest of your life.

BRANSON
At least I'll have a life.

--
[08:52, INT. SERVANTS' CORRIDOR - DAY]
[Mrs Patmore and Daisy talk as Lang comes down the stairs. He drops the clothes brush twice.]

MRS PATMORE
Cheer up. It's not as bad as that. What's the matter, Mr Lang? Tell me. I won't bite.

MR LANG
I sometimes feel I'm the only one who knows what's going on over there. And you all wander around ironing clothes and cleaning boots and choosing what's for dinner while, over the channel, men are killed, and maimed, and blown to pieces.

MRS PATMORE
We know more than you think. The war hasn't left us alone. It hasn't left me alone, however it may look.

MR LANG
Have you any idea how scared they are? How scared they all are?

MRS PATMORE
I lost my nephew, my sister's boy. H--he was shot...for cowardice. That's what they said. But I knew him, and he'd never have done such a thing if he hadn't've been half out of his mind with fear.

MR LANG
Don't blame him. It was him, but it could've been me. It could have been any of us.

[Mrs Patmore nods as he leaves.]

--
[10:28, EXT. COURTYARD - DAY]

THOMAS
Suppose I don't want to come back?

O'BRIEN
To be in charge? Telling Mr Carson what to do?

THOMAS
Why? What's in it for you?

O'BRIEN
All right, it's to stop Mrs Crawley bossing Her Ladyship about. She behaves as if she owns the place.

THOMAS
You've changed your tune. When I were last here, you'd've given money to see Her Ladyship eat dirt.

O'BRIEN
Well, like you say, I've changed me tune. People do.

THOMAS
Not without reason.

O'BRIEN
I've got me reasons.

THOMAS
You've also got Her Ladyship wrapped 'round your little finger.

O'BRIEN
Maybe that's my business. But I'll not hurt her. And I'll not let anyone else hurt her neither. That's all I've got to say.

THOMAS
You're a queer one, and no mistake.

O'BRIEN
So, will you come if I can fix it?

THOMAS
Why not? I like the idea of giving orders to old Carson.

[O'Brien smiles.]

[BREAK 1]

--
[11:32, INT. LIBRARY - DAY]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I go away for five minutes and everything's settled.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Nothing's settled. For a start, which rooms will we live in?

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
The small library and the boudoir.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
If Cousin Isobel can find somewhere else for the intermediaries.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
There's always the boot room. I'm sure you'll have use of that.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
And where are we supposed to eat?

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
You can share the dining room with those officers--

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
No.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
We all have to make sacrifices.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
No!

DR CLARKSON
Then we'll have tables set up in the Great Hall for the mobile officers and for the nurses. And Lady Grantham, I know you'll be happy about one decision. Lady Grantham asked that the house management might be put into the hands of Corporal Barrow, your former footman, Thomas.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Thomas? In charge of Downton?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
No, that's what I thought at first. But he isn't a footman now, he's a soldier. He's worked in medicine.

DR CLARKSON
The point is, someone has to run the place who's had medical training.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
But I really feel--

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
The men won't accept the authority of a corporal.

DR CLARKSON
I've thought of that. I told my commanding officer that Lady Grantham had asked for Corporal Barrow, and he's prepared to have him raised to the rank of acting sergeant.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
But can you spare him?

DR CLARKSON
We can. I've gone to some trouble to do so.

[Isobel is obviously not pleased with the arrangement. Cora is extremely pleased with the arrangement.]

DR CLARKSON
Sergeant Barrow will manage the daily running of Downton and I shall be in overall charge.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
But you have the hospital. Aren't we missing a tier. Surely there should be someone here permanently who is under you, but over Thomas.

DR CLARKSON
That's correct. And I will make a decision before long. Until then, I do assure you, Corporal Barrow is very efficient.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I say, good. If someone's to manage things, let it be our creature.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Why? Are you planning to divide his loyalties?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I wouldn't say I was planning it.

--
[13:14, INT. LORD GRANTHAM'S DRESSING ROOM - EVENING]

MR CARSON
William has asked to stay here, my lord. Just for a night. On his way to active duty in France.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Good. I should like to see him.

MR CARSON
I don't suppose there's any way we can keep him from harm? Him being an only child and all. We'd hate for anything to happen.

[Lang froze in the middle of fixing Robert's cufflinks.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Thank you, Lang, I can do the rest.

MR LANG
Very sorry, my lord.

[Lang leaves.]

MR CARSON
To get back to the notion of Thomas as the manager of Downton.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
He won't be a manager in that sense, but Her Ladyship fixed it all with Clarkson, and she was so pleased I didn't know what to say.

MR CARSON
I cannot have him working here because he is a thief?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You know she's ignorant of Thomas's crimes. We agreed, at the time, that would be best. And, anyway, is it honourable in us to hold Thomas's sins against him when he has been wounded in the service of the king?

MR CARSON
And who is to be in charge over Thomas?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You mean, under Dr Clarkson? Well, we asked today, but he hasn't decided.

MR CARSON
So, we just make it up as we go along.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Unless you've got a better idea.

--
[INT. SERVANTS' HALL - EVENING]

O'BRIEN
Are you still here, Mr Branson?

[They all stand as Mr Carson enters.]

MR CARSON
Why don't you stay and have something to eat.

ETHEL
Mr Branson's been telling us the news from Russia.

MR CARSON
And what news is that?

BRANSON
Kerensky's been made Prime Minister, but he won't go far enough for me. Lenin denounces the bourgeoisie along with the tsar. He wants a people's revolution. That's what I'm waiting for. Won't be long now.

MR CARSON
And what happened to the tsar?

BRANSON
Imprisoned in the Alexander Palace with all his family.

MRS PATMORE
Oh, what a dreadful thing.

BRANSON
They won't hurt them. Why would they?

ANNA
To make an example.

BRANSON
Give them some credit. This is a new dawn, a new age of government. No one wants to start it with the murder of a bunch of young girls.

MR LANG
You don't know that. Nobody knows who will get killed when these things start. Look at her nephew. Shot for cowardice.

[Mrs Patmore, and everyone else, stares at him in shock.]

MR LANG
Who would've guess that when he was saying hello to the neighbours, or kissing his mother goodnight.

[Daisy rushes in.]

DAISY
Can you look at the crumble? I think it should come out, but it's five minutes earli-- than you said.

[Mrs Patmore rushes out crying.]

MR LANG
I'm sorry. I never thought.

[Mrs Hughes gets up from the table to go after Mrs Patmore.]

MRS HUGHES
You should think, Mr Lang. You're not the only member of the walking wounded in this house.

--
[15:42, EXT/INT. DOWNTON, OUTER HALL - DAY]
[Someone rings at the front door. Mr Carson tries to make his way through the bustle of medical staff. Thomas enters through the front door.]

MR CARSON
Why are you coming in this way?

THOMAS
I'm the manager here now, Mr Carson. Or had you forgotten?

MR CARSON
No, I have not forgotten. And will you be moving into your old room, or should we prepare a guest bedroom?

THOMAS
I'll sleep in my old room, thanks. So, are we ready for the big invasion? 'Cause they'll be here at tea time.

MR CARSON
We'll have to be ready, won't we, Thomas?

THOMAS
We will, Mr Carson. And it's Sergeant Barrow now.

MR CARSON
Acting Sergeant, I believe.

[Robert wanders around the large library, which is now set up as the officers' recreation room. A nurse pulls out a screen to block of the small library. Lady Grantham looks unhappily at the great hall, now set up as the dining hall for the officers. The family walks out the front door to welcome the officers.]

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
How many [?] are there?

DR CLARKSON
Thirty-six.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Thirty-six? Right. Well, we'll get back to you.

DR CLARKSON
Quick as you can, gentlemen. Driver, use that road here and go straight into the hospital.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
This way, please, gentlemen.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
..suffered from mustard gas, and must be [?].

LADY SYBIL
Okay.

[Sybil walks into the house and speaks to a nurse and officer on crutches in the front hall.]

LADY SYBIL
Don't worry, we'll see to you.

[Sybil continues into the house.]

THOMAS
Major Bryant, you're in the Armada Bedroom. Do you mind the stairs?

MAJOR BRYANT
Depends on what I find at the top.

[Ethel catches sight of Major Bryant]

ETHEL
He's handsome.

O'BRIEN
Handsome and off limits.

ETHEL
It'll be nice to have the house full of men.

ANNA
Full of officers. Officers aren't men. Not where we're concerned.

EHTEL
Oh, speak for yourself.

ANNA
Speak for you too if you know what's good for you.

[Matthew enters and touches his mother's arm.]

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
I'm very sorry, but I--

[She looks up.]

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Matthew! What in the world are you doing here?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Well, we start our tour of Yorkshire and Lancashire tomorrow and General Strutt knew you lived up here, so he's given me a few hours off.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
What a lovely--

[She kisses his cheek.]

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Lovely surprise.

MRS HUGHES
Mrs Crawley, how can we separate the hospital's linen from our own?

[Mary enters to pick up a tray of carafes and freezes when she catches sight of Matthew.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
You go. We'll talk later.

--
[18:59, INT. DOWNTON ABBEY, WARD - DAY]

LADY EDITH
As soon as I've done this, I'll take your orders for books.

OFFICER 1
Thank you.

OFFICER 2
Nurse?

NURSE
Do you need help with [?]?

OFFICER 2
No, I'm fine.

[Mary distributes the carafes in the room.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I hadn't cast you as Florence Nightingale.

LADY MARY
We can't leave all the moral high ground to Sybil. She might get lonely there. How are you? I--I know I mustn't ask you what you're doing.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
You can ask what I'm doing in Downton. We've finished in the Midlands, and tomorrow we start in the camps in the northern counties.

LADY MARY
Ah. Will we see something of you?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I think my general ought to come here. It's exactly the sort of thing people like to read about.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Sybil, come, Edith can do that.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Dear Mother. She does love a bit of authority. I suppose she's driving Cousin Cora mad.

LADY MARY
No names, no pack drill.

[Mary puts a finger over her lips and they both smile.]

--
[19:47, INT. DOWNTON COTTAGE HOSPITAL, WARD - DAY]

DOCTOR
Breathe in.

[The doctor holds a stethoscope to Branson's chest as he breathes in.]

DOCTOR
And out.

[Branson exhales. The doctor takes off the stethoscope and fills out the medical form.]

DOCTOR
I'm surprised they didn't get you before now.

BRANSON
Some people have all the luck, sir.

DOCTOR
You can get dressed.

[Branson buttons up his shirt.]

BRANSON
Shall I report for duty in Richmond?

DOCTOR
You'll be told what to do.

--
[20:10, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - DAY]

THOMAS
But I must supervise the medical staff.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Overseen by me. And Carson, I'm relying on you to make that that is--

[Cora enters with Mrs Hughes behind her.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
What's going on?

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
I was arranging the household duties where they overlap with the duties of the nursing staff.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Shall we continue this upstairs?

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Well, I've made some charts and--

[Cora gives her a severe look.]

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Of course.

[Isobel and Cora leave.]

ETHEL
Did you say you were the manager or the referee?

O'BRIEN
You can see what we're up against.

THOMAS
Don't worry, we'll find a solution.

--
[20:49, INT. LIBRARY - DAY]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
You take over every room in the house, you bark at me like a sergeant major, and you give orders to my servants.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Cora, I'm sure Cousin--

[Mary enters.]

LADY MARY
I'm sorry, are you in the middle of something?

DR CLARKSON
We're discussing the arrangements.

LADY MARY
Oh, good, because we've had a letter from Evelyn Napier. He's in a hospital in Middlesbrough and he's heard that we're a convalescent home now, and wonders if he can come here once he's released.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Of course he can come here.

DR CLARKSON
Well, now, just a minute.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
There's no question of him coming here.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
What?

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
The Middlesbrough General will have their own arrangements for where their patients convalesce.

DR CLARKSON
I'm afraid Mrs Crawley is right. Downton must function as part of the official system, or it cannot function at all.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Now, I think, perhaps, I should make one thing clear. Downton is our house and our home, and we will welcome in it any friends or any relations we choose. And if you do not care to accept that condition, then I suggest you give orders for the nurses, and the patients, and the beds, and the rest of it, to be packed up and shipped out at once!

[Cora holds in a smile.]

DR CLARKSON
Thank you, Lord Grantham, for making your position so clear.

[Clarkson clears his throat and starts to leave.]

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Oh, just one more thing. The dog. What should we do to stop Isis getting into the patients' rooms?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I can answer that. Absolutely nothing.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Ah.

[BREAK 2]

--
[22:06, INT. LIBRARY - DAY]
[Robert tries to read the newspaper while officers are playing table tennis in the other section. The ball bounces over the screen and across his table. He puts his paper down for a moment, looks at the dog, then continues reading.]

--
[22:26, INT. GUEST BEDROOM - DAY]

LADY MARY
Anna, there you are. Ethel, could you leave us for a moment?

[Ethel leaves and closes the door behind her.]

LADY MARY
That was Sir Richard on the telephone. It might have been Bates you saw in the village.

ANNA
Really?

LADY MARY
He's working up here at a pub. The Red Lion in Kirkbymoorside.

ANNA
That's odd. Mr Bates in a pub.

LADY MARY
The question's what'll you do with the information now you've got it.

--
[23:01, EXT. DOWNTON ABBEY, FRONT DOOR - DAY]
[Branson shines the car while waiting for Robert. Sybil walks a wheelchair into the house with another nurse.]

LADY SYBIL
Would you just take this into the hall for me?

NURSE
Yes, of course.

[The nurse goes inside and Sybil goes to Branson.]

LADY SYBIL
Are you waiting for Papa? Do you want me to go and find him?

BRANSON
They turned me down. The army.

LADY SYBIL
Why?

BRANSON
Apparently I have a heart murmur. Or, to be more precise...

[Branson picks up the letter on car seat.]

BRANSON
A mitral valve prolapse is causing a pansystolic murmur.

LADY SYBIL
I don't know what to say. Is it dangerous.

BRANSON
Only if you're planning to humiliate the British army. I suppose you're glad.

LADY SYBIL
You're not going to be killed and you're not going to prison, of course I'm glad!

BRANSON
Don't count your chickens. If I don't get them one way, I'll get them another.

LADY SYBIL
Why do you have to be so angry all the time? I know we weren't exactly at our best in Ireland--

BRANSON
Not at your best? Not at your best? I lost a cousin in the Easter Rising last year.

LADY SYBIL
You never said.

BRANSON
Well, I'm saying it now. He was walking down North King's Street one day and an English soldier saw him and shot him dead. When they asked why he was killed, the officer said, "Because he was probably a rebel." So don't say you were not at your best.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Sorry to keep you waiting, but we're going to have to step on it.

[Branson opens the door for Robert, a furious expression still on his face. He glares at Sybil as he gets in the car and takes off.]

--
[24:43, INT. RECREATION ROOM - DAY]
[Edith hands an officer a book and picks up a large pile.]

LADY EDITH
I'm not sure about Marriott.

OFFICER
Oh, not to worry.

LADY EDITH
I know we've got lots of G.A. Henty.

OFFICER
Thank you very much.

LADY EDITH
And I haven't forgotten about your tobacco, Captain Ames, just as soon as I can get into the village.

[Mrs Hughes catches Ethel flirting with Major Bryant outside. She tucks a blanket around his legs.]

ETHEL
Is that better?

MAJOR BRYANT
Much. But I'm gonna need some more tucking very soon.

ETHEL
Well, no one tucks better than I do.

MRS HUGHES
Ethel. Go back inside please. There are still more bedrooms to be done.

--
[25:27, INT. THE DOWER HOUSE - DAY]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Rosamund's going to find out. She knows some of those feebleminded idiots on the liberal front bench.

LADY MARY
Poor Lavinia. I feel sorry for her.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
She's an obstacle to your happiness, dear, and must be removed. When it's done, you can feel as sorry as you wish.

LADY MARY
But even if Matthew does break it off with her, why should he propose to me again?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
With your permission, dear, I'll take my fancies one at a time.

--
[25:58, INT. HOUSEMAIDS' BEDROOM - NIGHT]
[Dressed for bed, Anna is practicing with the curling iron on her own hair.]

ETHEL
Any plans for your afternoon off? Major Bryant wants me to go to the pictures in York with him when he's allowed out. But you'll say that's stupid.

ANNA
Not stupid. Insane.

ETHEL
But he really likes me, though. He says he wants to get to know me better.

ANNA
Has he told you how he's planning how to achieve it?

ETHEL
Spoil sport. What you up to?

ANNA
Just practicing with these for Lady Mary. [?]

--
[26:34, EXT. KIRKBYMOORSIDE - DAY]
[Anna gets off the bus and enters The Red Lion. She peers through the frosted glass to see Bates at the bar before she enters.]

MR BATES
It's one and eight.

[Bates sees Anna.]

CUSTOMER
There you go.

ANNA
Might I have a glass of cider?

[Bates hands the customer his change.]

CUSTOMER
Thank you.

[The customer leaves and Anna approaches the bar.]

MR BATES
I don't know if I've dreaded this moment or longed for it.

ANNA
Well, either way, it's happened.

--
[27:45, INT. THE DOWER HOUSE - DAY]

LADY ROSAMUND
I'm glad I'm in time for tomorrow's state visit. I gather Lavinia will be there.

[Mary rolls her eyes.]

LADY ROSAMUND
We must seize the opportunity to challenge her.

LADY MARY
I don't really see on what basis.

LADY ROSAMUND
She stole secrets from her uncle, Jonathan Swire, and gave them to Carlisle to publish, Swire told me.

LADY MARY
And the paper showed that half the cabinet were trying to get rich by buying shares before a government contract was announced. Would you rather we were kept in ignorance?

LADY ROSAMUND
It wasn't Lavinia's business to make it public. Without her, the Marconi scandal would never have happened.

LADY MARY
The politicians broke the law. Lavinia did nothing wrong.

[Violet regards Mary with surprise.]

LADY ROSAMUND
She drags the chancellor of the exchequer's honour through the mud and you say it's nothing.

LADY MARY
It was only Lloyd George.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
But why did she betray her uncle to Sir Richard in the first place?

LADY ROSAMUND
Because...

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Oh--

LADY ROSAMUND
They were lovers. And now it's down to you to save Matthew from the clutches of a scheming harlot.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Really, Rosamund, there's no need to be so gleeful. You sound like Robespierre lopping off the head of Marie Antoinette.

[Violet laughs.]

--
[28:46, INT. THE RED LION - DAY]
[Bates and Anna sit at a table.]

MR BATES
It was me. I knew you used to go to the village on Wednesday. I so longed for a glimpse of you.

ANNA
But why're you up here at all? And why didn't you tell me?

MR BATES
Because I want to get things settled first. You see, I've discovered that Vera has been unfaithful to me. I've got proof.

ANNA
You can't criticise her for that.

MR BATES
No, but it means I can divorce her. I've had to leave the house to prove that it has broken the marriage. So I came up here to be nearer you.

ANNA
But what if she fights it?

MR BATES
She can't. For her to divorce me, she needs something beyond adultery, cruelty or such like. For a husband, adultery is enough.

ANNA
That's not very fair to women.

MR BATES
I don't care about fairness, I care about you. The point is, I can get rid of her. If she goes quietly, I will give her money and plenty of it. If not, she leaves empty handed.

ANNA
And when will this be?

MR BATES
I need to get her to accept it first. She's made threats about selling stuff to the papers.

ANNA
What stuff?

MR BATES
Don't worry. They won't offer what I will. You've changed your hair.

ANNA
I was trying out Lady Mary's new curling iron. What do you think?

[They smile at each other.]

MR BATES
I think I would love you however, and whatever, whenever.

ANNA
We don't have to wait, you know. If you want me to throw up everything and come with you, I will. Gladly.

MR BATES
I can't marry you yet. Not legally. And I won't break the law.

ANNA
It's not against the law to take a mistress, Mr Bates.

[She takes his hands.]

MR BATES
I know you, Anna Smith, and I love you, and that is not the right path for you. But it won't be long now.

[She's close to tears, but Anna nods.]

--
[30:59, EXT. COURTYARD - DAY]
[O'Brien steps out while Branson works.]

O'BRIEN
So, you're not going to war, then?

BRANSON
Apparently not. Is it true about Mr Crawley bringing a famous general here?

O'BRIEN
Captain Crawley. But yes. Why?

[Branson begins to plot.]

BRANSON
No reason.

--
[31:23, INT. LIBRARY - EVENING]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
If they arrive at five, we'll walk him around the wards, then show him the recovering men at play, and after that, a fairly grand dinner. I'll tell him to bring mesquite.

MR CARSON
That is my challenge, my lord. How to make the dinner sufficiently grand with no footmen in the house.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Plenty of people give dinners without footmen.

MR CARSON
Not people who entertain Sir Herbert Strutt, hero of the Somme.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
I'm sure he'll have seen worse things at the front than a dinner with no footmen.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Carson only wants to show the general proper respect. We will not criticise him for that.

DR CLARKSON
Indeed, we will not. But I think Lord Grantham's plan is a good one, with or without footmen.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Matthew writes Miss Swire is coming down from London for it.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Really? He never said so to me.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Does he need your permission?

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
I think I should go around with him.

DR CLARKSON
You and Lady Grantham will both come with us.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
But won't you want to talk about treatments?

DR CLARKSON
The treatments...and the house.

[Carson and Robert exchange a look.]

--
[32:25, INT. DOWNTON ABBEY, WARD - NIGHT]
[Edith enters the room and an officer whispers to her.]

CAPTAIN SMILEY
Miss.

LADY EDITH
It's Captain Smiley, isn't it?

[Edith sits next to the officer's bed.]

LADY EDITH
We haven't met yet, but I'm Edith Crawley. And tomorrow I can show you where everything is.

CAPTAIN SMILEY
It's just that I'd like to write a letter to my parents.

LADY EDITH
Of course. There's paper and envelopes in the library.

CAPTAIN SMILEY
No, you see, I've not written before because I--I didn't want to worry my mother with a different handwriting.

[Smiley pulls his left arm out from under the sheet and his hand is missing. Edith is in shock.]

CAPTAIN SMILEY
I'm left-handed. How's that for luck?

LADY EDITH
I'm surprised your school didn't force you to use the right.

CAPTAIN SMILEY
My mother wouldn't let them. But now I wish they had. I've asked the others, and they say you're the one to help me.

LADY EDITH
Of course I will. I'd be happy to.

CAPTAIN SMILEY
That's what they said. If you can just find a way to tell her.

LADY EDITH
We'll both find a way. Together. I promise.

--
[33:40, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - NIGHT]
[Branson knocks on the doorway where Mr Carson is putting away the silver.]

BRANSON
Mr Carson, might I have a word.

MR CARSON
I'm busy with this dinner for tomorrow night.

BRANSON
Well, that's just it. I don't expect you'll be using Mr Lang, not after last time.

MR CARSON
I will not.

BRANSON
So I wondered if I might be any help. I've waited a table before.

MR CARSON
Do you mean it?

[Branson nods.]

MR CARSON
I know I've no right to ask it of a chauffeur.

BRANSON
We have to keep up the honour of Downton, don't we?

MR CARSON
I'm very grateful, Mr Branson. I'll not hide it, very grateful, indeed. You know where to find the livery?

BRANSON
I do.

MR CARSON
And I gather you won't be leaving us after all.

BRANSON
Who knows what the future will bring.

--
[34:22, INT. SERVANTS' BEDROOM CORRIDOR - NIGHT]
[Mr Lang is yelling in his sleep. All of the servants wake up and get out of bed.]

ANNA
What is it?

MRS HUGHES
...shouting.

MR CARSON
What's going on?

[Mrs Hughes opens the door into the men's section.]

MRS HUGHES
... to find out.

THOMAS
It's Mr Lang.

MRS HUGHES
What in heaven's name is happening?

[Mr Lang is thrashing around in his bed.]

MR LANG
No! No, I can't do it!

MR CARSON
Mr Lang?

MR LANG
I can't do it!

[Mr Carson shakes Mr Lang awake.]

MR CARSON
You're having a bad dream, Mr Lang! You're having a dream!

MR LANG
They're soldiers, Mr Carson! I see soldiers, but I can't!

[O'Brien goes to Lang's side.]

MR LANG
I can't go back no matter what!

MR CARSON
No one's asking you to go back, Mr Lang.

THOMAS
No, just to put a sock in it.

O'BRIEN
Don't worry, Mr Lang, you've had a bad dream, that's all.

[Mr Lang looks at O'Brien.]

MR LANG
Is it a dream?

[O'Brien nods. Lang begins to sob.]

MR LANG
Thank God.

[Mr Carson nods to the others and they leave.]

MR LANG
Oh, thank God. Thank God.

O'BRIEN
You're all right. Let's get you back into bed. You're all right.

[O'Brien helps him lay down.]

MR LANG
I'm sorry.

O'BRIEN
It's all right, Mr Lang.

[O'Brien covers him with the blanket.]

MR LANG
I'm sorry.

O'BRIEN
You're all right.

[O'Brien looks at Mr Carson and Mrs Hughes still standing there.]

O'BRIEN
Is it any wonder when he's been to hell and back?

[BREAK 3]

--
[35:41, EXT. DOWNTON ABBEY FRONT DOOR - DAY]
[The entire household lines up outside to welcome the general. The car drives by and the soldiers solute. The general's party gets out and solutes the family.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
My cousin, Lord Grantham.

GENERAL STRUTT
This is very kind of you, Lord Grantham.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Welcome.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Lady Grantham. And this is Major Clarkson who runs our hospital here.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
And I am Captain Crawley's mother. And will accompany you on your tour and explain the different levels of care we practice here.

[Clarkson and Matthew's expressions reveal the impropriety of Isobel putting herself forward.]

DR CLARKSON
Lady Grantham and Mrs Crawley will both accompany us as we go around, sir.

GENERAL STRUTT
Makes a nice change from the craggy-faced warriors I'm usually surrounded by.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I'd like to think that were true. Please, come this way.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
There's a large recreation room...

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I don't believe you've ever been to Downton before.

[Mary steps up to Matthew.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Poor mother. She longs to hold all the reigns.

GENERAL STRUTT
Crawley?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I should go. If only to keep our respective mothers apart.

THOMAS
I'm afraid Mrs Crawley's none too pleased to play second fiddle, sir.

DR CLARKSON
Well, I hope she doesn't spoil things.

THOMAS
Well, that's just what I've been meaning to talk to you about, sir. You see, I'm trying to run a tight ship...

[O'Brien watches Thomas suspiciously. Rosamund gives Mary a significant look, then smiles at Lavinia before heading into the house, which makes Mary uncomfortable.]

LAVINIA
What's the matter with your aunt?

LADY MARY
We should follow them in. Poor mama will say we're unsupportive.

LAVINIA
Tell me what it is, please.

LADY MARY
All right.

--
[37:15, INT. KITCHENS - DAY]

DAISY
I know he's going to propose.

MRS PATMORE
Well, then you're going to accept. Did you get that picture taken?

DAISY
I did, yeah.

MRS PATMORE
Fetch it. Because if you think I'm gonna stand by and watch that boy's dreams stamped in the dust, you've got another thing coming. You can take back your promise when the war's over and not before.

DAISY
But it's a lie.

MRS PATMORE
Don't make him give up when he's off to face the guns. You'd never forgive yourself if ought happed.

--
[37:43, INT. OUTER HALL - DAY]

LADY MARY
Do you remember when Aunt Rosamund found you and Richard Carlisle together in the garden?

LAVINIA
I knew I'd hear more about that.

LADY MARY
She thought he was threatening you. And now she's decided that you were behind the Marconi share scandal in 1912. The chancellor and other ministers were involved, including your uncle.

LAVINIA
I remember the Marconi scandal.

LADY MARY
No, let's forget it. It's absurd.

LAVINIA
But Lady Rosamund is right. I did steal the evidence for Sir Richard to print. I did start the scandal.

LADY MARY
The trouble is, Aunt Rosamund can't understand why you would do such a thing unless you and Sir Richard were...

LAVINIA
Were lovers.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Mary. You must come.

[Mary follows her mother in shock.]

--
[38:30, INT. DOWNTON ABBEY, WARD - DAY]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
The ground floor rooms are for those men who the need most care, sir.

GENERAL STRUTT
Yes, of course.

CAPTAIN SMILEY
General Strutt, sir.

GENERAL STRUTT
Oh, right, yes. Tell me about this officer.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Who is that man? I hope he's not complaining.

LADY EDITH
Oh, no. That's Captain Smiley. He hasn't an unkind bone in his body.

LADY MARY
How do you know?

GENERAL STRUTT
Matthew, listen to this.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Everything all right, sir?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
What on earth's that about?

LADY EDITH
Oh, don't worry. Major Haimes can be a little waspish, but he wouldn't want to get us into trouble.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
How do you know so much about a pack of strangers?

LADY EDITH
They're not strangers to me.

GENERAL STRUTT
This is all very impressive, Lady Grantham. The nurses and your own staff to be congratulated.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I believe they are.

--
[39:21, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - DAY]

WILLIAM
I wouldn't say I was scared. I'm nervous. Course I am. But not scared. I think I'm ready.

[Mrs Patmore is crying.]

MRS PATMORE
Don't mind me. Only I'm thinking of what your dear mother would say.

WILLIAM
Well, I wish she was here to see me off.

MRS PATMORE
Oh, she'd be so proud. Why, when we waved off our Arch, I rememb...

[Mrs Patmore breaks down.]

MRS HUGHES
What do you remember Mrs Patmore? I'll tell you. You remember a fine young man who enlisted before he had to and who gave his life for his country, because he'd be alive and well today if he hadn't chosen to go to war.

DAISY
She's right.

MRS PATMORE
That she is. Come on, Daisy, back to the grindstone.

[William stands up.]

MRS PATMORE
What is it?

WILLIAM
I just want a word with Daisy.

DAISY
I'm needed in the kitchen.

MRS PATMORE
There's plenty of time later on.

[Branson enters in the footman's livery, a dark expression on his face.]

--
[40:25, INT. RECREATION ROOM - DAY]
[The general plays a game.]

GENERAL STRUTT
[?] my aim.

DR CLARKSON
And again.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You must be enjoying your respite from the front.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Actually I'm struggling a bit. I've just lost my soldier servant and I haven't managed to replace him yet.

[Mary regards Lavinia tensely.]

LADY ROSAMUND
So, when will you tell Matthew?

MR CARSON
Dinner is served, my lady.

LADY ROSAMUND
Don't waste the opportunity.

[Rosamund gets up for dinner.]

LADY MARY
Why must she be so savage? It's my broken heart, and it was her advice that wrecked it in the first place.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Classic Rosamund. She's never more righteous than when she's in the wrong. Come on.

--
[40:59, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - DAY]
[Branson walks briskly down the hall.]

MRS HUGHES
Everything all right, Mr Branson?

BRANSON
I think so, Mrs Hughes.

[Branson takes a breath and then carries a dish up the stairs.]

--
[41:12, INT. LADY SYBIL'S BEDROOM - DAY]
[Anna finds a note on the floor. On one side it says "Lady Sybil" on the back "Forgive me." Anna opens the note and her jaw drops. She runs through the hallways to the servants' hall while Mr Branson enters the dining room. Anna runs into Mrs Hughes's sitting room.]

ANNA
Where's Mr Branson?

MRS HUGHES
He's just taken up the soup, why?

[Anna shows Mrs Hughes the note.]

ANNA
Read that.

MRS HUGHES
"They'll have arrested me by now, but I'm not sorry. The bastard had it coming to him"?

[Mrs Hughes's jaw drops.]

MRS HUGHES
Oh!

[They run to Mr Carson.]

MR CARSON (whisper)
What in God's name?

MRS HUGHES (whisper)
Read this! Where is he now?

MR CARSON
Oh, my God.

--
[42:31, INT. DINING ROOM - DAY]
[Branson glares at the general. Mr Carson and Anna cross the room to him just as Branson is about to pull the lid off of the soup. Mr Carson clamps his hand down over Branson's, so he can't open it.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I'm sorry to hear about your servant.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Yes. Pneumonia and not a bullet.

BRANSON (whisper)
No!

MR CARSON (whisper)
Yes.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I don't envy you.

[Branson struggles for a minute, then looks at Sybil behind him and eventually let's Carson escort him out. Mary notices as Anna follows them with the soup tray. Mr Carson shoves Branson through the door.]

MR CARSON (whisper)
Get downstairs now!

[Branson makes to go back through the door, but Carson twists his arm behind his back and forces him all the way to the servants' hall.]

BRANSON
All right! All right! There's no need to be so rough!

[Carson shoves him into the kitchen.]

MR CARSON
There's every need! To stop a murder!

BRANSON
Murder? What do you mean "murder"?

ANNA
You were going to assassinate the general!

BRANSON
Kill the general?! I was not!

[Anna lifts the lid on the soup and they all gag.]

ANNA
Ugh!

BRANSON
I was going to throw that lot all over him.

ANNA
What is it?

BRANSON
Oil and ink and a bit of a cow pie, all mixed with sour milk. He'd have needed a bath, right enough, but not a coffin!

[Mrs Patmore turns her head away as she pours it down the sink.]

DAISY
I thought you'd taken the soup up, but you left it in the pantry.

[Mrs Hughes grabs a copper pot from the shelf.]

MRS HUGHES
We'll use this. It's not bee heated, but the hell with that! And we'll decide what happens to you later.

MR CARSON
Nevermind later, what about now? How do we keep this dinner going?

WILLIAM
I'll serve, Mr Carson. I don't mind. Who knows when I'll have the chance again?

--
[44:00, INT. DINING ROOM - DAY]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
What was going on with the soup? It came, it went.

MR CARSON
Nothing to worry about, my lord. Branson was taken ill so William volunteered to be footman one last time. You don't mind, do you?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Oh, not a bit. It was very kind of him.

[Carson leaves.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Our footman, William, is leaving us tomorrow to join his regiment, that's why he's not in livery.

GENERAL STRUTT
Well, you're a credit to this house and this country, young man. There is no livery so becoming as a uniform.

WILLIAM (nods)
Sir.

[Robert nods to William.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Lady Rosamund, Mary, all of you, have been so kind to Lavinia.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Well, naturally. We're all curious to know more of Miss Swire if she's to reign over Downton's queen.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Dear me, I hope you haven't unearthed anything too fearful.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
You must ask Mary.

[Many significant looks are exchanged.]

GENERAL STRUTT
One thing I'm still not quite clear about. Who, precisely, is in charge of Downton when you're not here?

DR CLARKSON
I've given it some thought, sir, and it seems to be only fair that Mrs Crawley...

[Isobel smiles]

DR CLARKSON
...and Lady Grantham...

[Isobel's smile fades. Cora smiles very happily.]

DR CLARKSON
...should share that responsibility.

GENERAL STRUTT
Capital. Well said.

[Thomas and O'Brien, listening in, smirk at each other.]

GENERAL STRUTT
The fact is, I have been more than gratified by my visit here today, and I thank Captain Crawley for arranging it.

[Matthew nods.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Here, here.

GENERAL STRUTT
You are all to be praised for your response to our national crisis, but I've been talking and I've been listening, and I feel there is one among you whose generosity is in danger of going unremarked.

[Both Isobel and Cora wait expectantly.]

GENERAL STRUTT
It seems the daily cares and needs of the patients are being dealt with quietly and efficiently by Lady Edith.

[Surprised, everyone stares at Edith.]

GENERAL STRUTT
Or that's what the officers tell me. So, let us raise our glasses and drink her health.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Edith.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Darling.

ALL
Lady Edith.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Edith, dear.

[Edith smiles in wonder of the compliment.]

--
[45:52, INT. LIBRARY - DAY]
[After dinner, Lavinia and Mary sneak into the library.]

LAVINIA
We were never lovers. Not ever.

LADY MARY
You don't have to explain anything. Not to me.

LAVINIA
But I want to. You see, my father owed Sir Richard Carlisle a lot of money. Enough to bankrupt him.

LADY MARY
And Sir Richard offered to waive the debt if you gave him the evidence of the minister's guilt.

LAVINIA
Papa was terrified, and I knew I could get into my uncle's office and find the proof.

LADY MARY
What is it?

LAVINIA
He threatened to tell you all about it, and now I've told you anyway. My uncle was guilty. They all were. Sir Richard didn't make it up.

LADY MARY
I believe you.

LAVINIA
But that's not why I did it. It was entirely to save Papa from ruin.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM (O.S.)
I'll-- I'll just go and check if everything's ready.

--
[46:53, INT. KITCHENS - DAY]

WILLIAM
Have you got that picture for me?

DAISY
I might have.

[Daisy pulls the photo out of her pocket and hands it to William. He looks at it for a moment.]

WILLIAM
Because...you know what I'm going to ask you, so...will you?

DAISY
William, you're not sure. You can't be sure.

WILLIAM
I am sure.

MRS PATMORE
So is she. Aren't you, Daisy? Isn't this just what you told me you hoped would happen? It's like a fairy story.

[Daisy is speechless by Mrs Patmore's deceptive betrayal.]

WILLIAM
Is she right? Daisy are-- are we engaged? Because, if we are, I know I can tackle whatever may come.

[Daisy hesitates as she looks mortified between Mrs Patmore and William.]

DAISY
Go on, then.

[William beams and hugs Daisy.]

MRS HUGHES
William?!

[William lets go of Daisy.]

MRS HUGHES
Do you want to go up top? The general's leaving and Mr Carson likes a full compliment.

[Daisy tries to say something to Mrs Hughes.]

MRS HUGHES
No, Daisy not you. The war has not changed everything.

--
[48:03, INT. LIBRARY - DAY]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
The general's just about to leave. I'm afraid he doesn't have time to come in here.

LADY MARY
I hope it's all been a success.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Cousin Violet said you had something to say to me about Lavinia. What is it?

LADY MARY
I haven't the slightest idea.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
What a relief. She was hinting you'd uncovered some horrid stain.

LADY MARY
The only evidence I've uncovered is that she's a charming person.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
What a testimonial.

LADY MARY
The truth is, we're very much alike. So, naturally, I think she's perfect.

[Matthew chuckles.]

LADY MARY
We all do. Don't we? Aunt Rosamund?

LADY ROSAMUND
Quite perfect.

--
[48:49, INT. FRONT DOOR - DAY]
[The servants line up as the party leaves. Mr Lang struggles with shell shock.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Is there any chance you might take our footman, William, for your servant? I can pull some strings, get him transferred to your lot.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
If you'd like me to, of course. I can't promise to keep him safe.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I know, but...he'd have someone looking out for him. Oh, my God.

[Robert sees Lang shaking.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Lang, are you all right, old chap?

[Lang grabs onto Robert and buries his head in his chest.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Come, come, man. Things can't be as bad as all that. Carson.

MR CARSON
Mr Lang, what happened?

MR LANG
The general and all these officers, I don't have to go back with them, do I? Because I can't.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
No.

MR CARSON
The general's looking for you, my lord.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY (to the general)
Excuse me a moment.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
It's been a great pleasure having you...

MATTHEW CRAWLEY (to Lavinia)
If I don't see you again before I have to go back, be safe.

[Matthew kisses her hand.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY (to Mary)
You, too.

[Mary nods. Mr Carson steps in front of Mr Lang to hide him from the departing company, O'Brien comforts Lang.]

[Break 4]

--
[50:06, INT. MR CARSON'S OFFICE - EVENING]
[Mr Carson pours Mrs Hughes a drink.]

MR CARSON
Here. We've earned it.

MRS HUGHES
Ah. So, what will you do with him?

MR CARSON
Branson or Lang?

MRS HUGHES
Not Mr Lang. He isn't well, but he's not a bad man.

MR CARSON
No, not at all. But he doesn't belong at Downton.

MRS HUGHES
Mm. I meant Mr Branson.

MR CARSON
Mm, it's a delicate business, Mrs Hughes. Would we really be right to tell the police and cause a furore and bring riot down on our heads? And all because he wanted to pour a pot of slop over a man's head?

MRS HUGHES
From your phrasing, I gather the answer you want from me is "no"?

MR CARSON
Well, would it help, Mrs Hughes? That's all I'm asking. Would it help?

[50:55, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - EVENING]

ETHEL
Where is Mr Branson?

ANNA
Mr Carson sent him back to his cottage to stew in his own juice. Will we see you in the morning, William? To wish you luck?

WILLIAM
Oh, yes. But I've got something I'd like to say now.

[William takes Daisy's hand.]

WILLIAM
If you don't mind.

DAISY
Don't, not yet.

WILLIAM
They must know sooner or later. Daisy and I are going to be married.

ETHEL
You never are! When?!

DAISY
After the war.

WILLIAM
I'm not sure I can wait that long.

[Daisy looks worriedly at Mrs Patmore.]

[51:26, INT. SERVANTS' BEDROOMS - EVENING]
[Mr Carson knocks on Mr Lang's door, then enters. Mr Lang is packing.]

MR CARSON
I see what I planned to say is already superfluous, Mr Lang. You got there before me.

MR LANG
I've let you down, Mr Carson. For that I'm sorry.

MR CARSON
We let you down. You weren't suited for work, and I should've spotted that. You'll have two months' wages, and please tell us how you get on. And when you're ready work again, you may rely on a good report from me.

MR LANG
That's kind. Thank you.

[52:16, INT. LADY GRANTHAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
It's nice of William to serve tonight. He didn't have to.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I'm going to arrange for him to be Matthew's servant. With any luck, it'll keep him out of trouble.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Matthew and Mary look so natural together, did you notice? Talking and laughing. But I suppose Lavinia's a nice girl.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
We've dreamed a dream, my dear, but now it's over. The world was in a dream before, but now it's woken up and said goodbye to it. And so must we.
