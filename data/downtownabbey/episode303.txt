VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Oh! Hello, Edith, dear.

LADY EDITH
Hello, Granny. Isn’t it exciting?

[Edith assists Violet over the rolled up carpet, Alfred stands by with a ready arm.]

VIOLET
At my age, one must ration one’s excitement.

--
[01:10, INT. DRAWING ROOM – DAY]
[Cora and a maid are arranging the gifts as Cora and Edith enter.]

VIOLET
See, I told her everything would come right, but she wouldn’t believe me.

EDITH
I still can’t. Something happening in this house is actually about me.

[Cora smiles.]

EDITH
The dress came this morning.

VIOLET
I was rather sad you decided against Patou. I would’ve paid.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Lucile was safer. We don’t want her to look like a chorus girl.

[Edith smiles with a chuckle.]

VIOLET
How is Anthony? Excited, I hope.

EDITH
Desperately. Just when he thought his life would never change, he’s going right back to the beginning.

VIOLET
Oh. What an invigorating prospect.

[Cora gives Violet a look.]

--
[01:41, INT. SERVANTS’ CORRIDOR - DAY]

SARAH O’BRIEN
I hope you’ve got your shirt ready for tonight.

THOMAS BARROW
In case you’re interested, I’ve hidden a couple, so I won’t be caught out that way again.

O’BRIEN
Why should I be interested?

THOMAS
That goes for you, too.

ALFRED NUGENT
What have I done?

O’BRIEN
Take no notice.

[They go separate ways. Anna puts on a coat as she walks down the corridor.]

MRS HUGHES
Anna?

[Anna stops and turns around.]

MRS HUGHES
Are the flowers done?

ANNA BATES
Yes.

[Mrs Hughes joins her as she walks.]

ANNA
I’ll check them on Saturday morning and lose anything that’s going over. I’ve kept back a few in bud. I’ll be home for the dressing gong.

MRS HUGHES
Oh, we’ll manage.

[Anna leaves and Mrs Patmore approaches Mrs Hughes.]

MRS PATMORE
Still no word from the doctor?

[Mrs Hughes waits for the door to close full behind Anna. They speak in hushed voices.]

MRS HUGHES
I’d have told you if there was.

MRS PATMORE
[?] they don’t mind stringing it out. Should we go and see him?

[Mr Carson hears part of their conversation through the open door nearby.]

MRS HUGHES
Why? I’m sure if he knew anything, he would have said.

[Carson’s jaw drops in surprise.]

--
[02:21, INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY]
[Thomas catches Molesley as he exits Matthew’s dressing room.]

THOMAS
How are you today, Mr Molesley?

[Molesley drops some of the clothes he’s carrying as he turns around and Thomas picks them up for him.]

MR MOLESLEY
Er, very well, thank you.

[Thomas follows alongside Molesley.]

THOMAS
You were talking the other night about your friend’s daughter. Is she still looking for a place?

MR MOLESLEY
She is. You read about the servant shortage in the newspapers, but you can’t find a situation for a lady’s maid, not one. She’ll end up as a house maid if she’s not careful.

THOMAS
Well, we can’t have that, Mr Molesley. But if I were to tell you something...

[Thomas stops Molesley.]

THOMAS
You must promise not to breathe a word of it downstairs. Miss O’Brien doesn’t want it known.

[Thomas opens the servants’ door for Molesley with a smile.]

--
[03:02, INT. LIBRARY - DAY]
[Cora arranges flowers while Robert sits at his desk and Tom and Matthew read on the couches.]

CORA
How will they advertise it?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I don’t know exactly. “Desirable nobleman’s mansion with surrounding estate and properties.”

TOM BRANSON
Where will you go?

ROBERT
We have some land further north at Eryholme, on the border with Durham. It came with my great-grandmother. The house is pretty and we might make something of it. We could always rename it “Downton Place.”

[Cora sits down.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Who lives there now?

ROBERT
A tenant. But we can come to an arrangement that keeps him happy.

CORA
Let’s take a picnic there tomorrow. Take a break from the wedding on Edith’s last day of freedom.

[Mary and Sybil enter.]

LADY MARY
Molesley’s in the hall. He wonders if he might have a word.

MATTHEW
I’ll come through in a minute.

MARY
Not with you, with Mamma.

[Matthew looks up from his newspaper in surprise.]

MARY
Molesley.

[Molesley enters with a smile. Then his face falls to find the entire family there.]

MR MOLESLEY
Your Ladyship, may I have a word?

CORA
Of course.

[Cora nods with a smile and a nod, but doesn’t move. Molesley proceeds nervously.]

MR MOLESLEY
Milady, might I be allowed to put forward a candidate as Miss O’Brien’s replacement?

CORA
What?

[Robert turns around in surprise.]

MR MOLESLEY
When the time comes.

[Robert walks over.]

ROBERT
Is O’Brien leaving?

MR MOLESLEY
I hope I’ve not spoken out of turn. Only, I didn’t want to let it go and miss the chance. I thought you knew.

CORA
Of course I know. Thank you, Molesley. I’ll be happy to listen to recommendations when, as you say, the time comes.

MR MOLESLEY
Thank you, milady.

[Molesley bows to her and the others and exits.]

ROBERT
Well, I must confess, I will watch her departure with mixed emotions.

MARY
Mine are fairly unmixed.

[Tom smiles in amusement.]

SYBIL BRANSON
Did you have a clue?

CORA
Not a clue. How very disappointing.

ROBERT
But, in a way, it raises the big question: when do we tell the staff that the end is nigh?

MARY
It makes it sound so final.

[Robert takes Cora’s hand.]

ROBERT
I’m afraid it is final.

MARY
Well, don’t spoil Edith’s day. Let us get through the wedding first and then tell them afterwards.

[04:46, EXT. DOWNTON COTTAGE HOSPITAL - DAY]
[Carson meets Dr Clarkson just as he’s exiting the hospital.]

MR CARSON
Oh, er, Dr Clarkson!

[Clarkson stop and Carson catches up to him.]

Do you have a minute?

DR CLARKSON
Er, one minute, yes. Do you mind if we...?

[Clarkson motions forward and Carson steps into stride beside him.]

MR CARSON
No. Only, I know that Mrs Hughes is suffering from a condition and I wondered if there was anything I could do to help.

DR CLARKSON
Well, you can help by lessening her duties. That’s really all I can say.

MR CARSON
But you can’t tell me how serious it is?

[Clarkson stops.]

DR CLARKSON
I’m afraid not. Even if I knew, which I don’t. Yet. Good day to you, Mr Carson.

[Clarkson tips his hat to Carson and walks on.]

--
[05:18, INT. MARY AND MATTHEW’S - EVENING]

MATTHEW
I had a telephone call from Charkham earlier.

MARY
Charkham?

MATTHEW
Reggie Swire’s lawyer. It seems the death certificate has arrived from India. He wants to bring it here.

MARY
Well, can’t he send it?

MATTHEW
He wants to bring it. He was quite definite. I’ve told him he can come tomorrow. There’s nothing going on particularly, is there?

MARY
You know there is. We’re taking a picnic to [?] to see the house we have to move into.

[Matthew closes his eyes as he remembers.]

MARY
I’m surprised you, of all people, can forget that.

[Matthew sighs with his hand over his eyes.]

MATTHEW
Well, he’s coming in the morning. I won’t put him off.

[Mary exhales with an annoyed nod.]

MARY
So this is the moment when you receive a huge fortune that could save Downton and you give it away.

MATTHEW (heavy sigh)
Will you choose where to give it?

MARY
How can I? I’d give it all to Papa.

MATTHEW
My darling, I hope, in some small part of you, you can understand.

MARY
I’m trying. Really, I am. But I can’t pretend I’m doing very well.

[Mary marches out and Matthew heaves another frustrated sigh.]

--
[06:12, INT. LADY GRANTHAM’S BEDROOM – EVENING]
[Cora looks at O’Brien with a sad frown as she fixes Cora’s dress.]

O’BRIEN
Will there be anything more, milady?

CORA
No. Unless you have something you want to tell me.

O’BRIEN
What might that be, milady?

CORA
I won’t prompt you, O’Brien, if you’re not ready to say.

[Robert enters. O’Brien leaves confused and Cora watches her go sadly.]

ROBERT
Did she tell you why?

CORA
No. Maybe she doesn’t want to until she’s settled where she’s going, but she has let me down.

ROBERT
We should go. Strallan won’t be late. He never is, worst luck.

CORA
Oh. I know you’re not happy. But Edith will be in the same county. Locksley’s a nice house and the estate will give her plenty to do.

ROBERT
She’ll be a nurse, Cora. And by the time she’s fifty, she’ll be wheeling around a one-armed old man.

[Cora tilts her head at him with a smile and opens the door.]

--
[07:08, INT. KITCHENS - EVENING]

MRS PATMORE
Er, are you waiting down here ‘til they come in search of the pudding?

ALFRED
Er, no, Mrs Patmore.

[Alfred takes the tray and exits. Mrs Patmore sees Mr Carson waiting in the corridor.]

MRS PATMORE
Can I do something for you?

MR CARSON
Well, I’d better get back upstairs, but, erm... while you’re here...

[Mr Carson motions for her to walk with him.]

MR CARSON
I saw Dr Clarkson today.

[Mrs Patmore looks up, her mouth open.]

MRS PATMORE
Oh?

MR CARSON
I’m worried about Mrs Hughes.

MRS PATMORE
We’re all worried. But I don’t think he should’ve told you.

MR CARSON
He said it would help if we lessened her work load.

MRS PATMORE
I’m sure it would. But she won’t be pleased he’s been talking about her before it’s been confirmed.

MR CARSON
So, it is cancer?

MRS PATMORE
Not until it’s confirmed.

[Carson turns in concern.]

MRS PATMORE
But don’t say anything. She’d hate to think the doctor had told you.

MR CARSON
He didn’t tell me, Mrs Patmore. You told me.

[Mrs Patmore’s mouth opens and she sighs as she realises her mistake.]

--
ACT TWO
[08:11, INT. DINING ROOM – EVENING]
[Robert and his sons-in-law visit after the ladies have withdrawn.]

SIR ANTHONY STRALLAN
Lady Edith—I mean, er...Edith tells me that you’re very interested in politics.

TOM
W—

ROBERT
Tom is our tame revolutionary.

SIR ANTHONY
Every family should have one.

[Tom smiles.]

MATTHEW
As long as you are “tame.”

TOM
Tame enough for a game of billiards.

[Matthew and Tom smile.]

TOM
What about it?

[Matthew tilts his head in agreement and they down their drinks and stand up.]

MATTHEW
Can you tell them where we’ve gone?

[They exit.]

ROBERT
We’re getting used to Tom. And I hope you will, too.

SIR ANTHONY
We haven’t spoken, really, since it was all settled. I want you to know that I quite understand why you were against it.

ROBERT
Yes. Well...

SIR ANTHONY
I just hope you believe that I mean to do my level best to make her happy.

ROBERT
I do believe that. It was never at all personal, you know.

SIR ANTHONY
No, of course not. No. It’s just...because of all this and...

[Strallan indicates his bad arm.]

SIR ANTHONY
I’m far too old.

ROBERT
Anthony...the thing is done. There’s no point in raking it over.

SIR ANTHONY
But are you happy about it?

ROBERT
I’m happy Edith is happy. I’m happy you mean to keep her happy. That is quite enough happiness to be going on with.

[Strallan doesn’t seem to take the comment very well.]

--
[09:21, INT. SERVANTS’ CORRIDOR – EVENING]
[Mrs Hughes goes over the menus with Carson.]

MRS HUGHES
There’s been a last minute change of mind about the wedding menus.

MR CARSON
Couldn’t Mrs Patmore do it?

MRS HUGHES
Mrs Patmore’s given me her new order list. She’s done her job. It’s time for me to do mine.

MR CARSON
I just don’t want you to get tired.

[Mrs Hughes stops on her way up the stairs and spins around to look at him.]

MRS HUGHES
Who have you been speaking to?

[Carson hesitates.]

MR CARSON
No one. What do you mean?

MRS HUGHES
Nothing. I don’t mean a thing. Now, let me get on.

[Mrs Hughes continues up the stairs.]

--
[INT. WOMEN’S SHELTER - DAY]
[Mrs Crawley tries to teach sewing to women off the streets.]

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
This is a simple stitch, but strong, and very useful in a drama.

MAVIS
When do we get sommat to eat?

ISOBEL
As I was saying, you should start it about, well, I would say, about half an inch away from the centre line...

[The women she’s teaching stare at Ethel entering behind Isobel, and she turns around and goes to her.]

ISOBEL
Oh, I’m glad you’ve come back. I do hope you’ve come for our help. You’d be so welcome if you have.

ETHEL PARKS
You wouldn’t say that if you knew what I am, ma’am. I’m past help.

ISOBEL
Nobody’s past help. And if you mean by that, you’re a prostitute...

[Ethel’s eyes widen in shock.]

ISOBEL
Well, then you should know that it is true of every woman who has come here to rebuild their lives, and I’m helping them. And I very much hope that I can help you, too.

MAVIS
That’s right. Why not come in and help us rebuild our lives?

[All the women cackle.]

ETHEL
That’s not why I’m here, Mrs Crawley. That is, I am a...what you said...but I don’t want help. Not for myself, but...

[Ethel looks over at the other women watching.]

ETHEL
The trouble is, every time I make up my mind, I change it. I’m sorry. This has been a mistake.

[Ethel rushes out.]

ISOBEL
Oh, please, please, don’t go. Not again.

[The other women laugh.]

--
[10:52, INT. LIBRARY - DAY]
[Matthew stares at the letter in his hand.]

MR CHARKHAM
It must be strange to receive a letter from a dead man.

MATTHEW
It’s very strange.

[Mary enters and Matthew quickly puts the letter in his coat pocket.]

MARY
We’re leaving. I’m sorry, Mr Charkham, to snatch him away.

MR CHARKHAM
It’s quite all right, Lady Mary.

[Charkham picks up his briefcase and shakes Matthew’s hand.]

MR CHARKHAM
There will be papers to sign.

MATTHEW
Yes, I expect there will.

[Charkham exits and Mary stares after him for a moment.]

MARY
Papa has asked Anthony to meet us there so we can all face the future together.

[Matthew nods.]

MARY
He’s bringing Isobel and Granny.

MATTHEW
It’s hard for your grandmother.

MARY
Matthew, it’s torture for all of us. And if I ever look as if I’m finding it easy to lose my home, then I am putting on an act.

[Matthew watches Mary with a troubled expression as she leaves.]

--
[11:42, EXT. FRONT DOOR – DAY]

MR CARSON
You sure you can manage this?

ALFRED
Quite sure, Mr Carson.

MR CARSON
It’s nothing hard. It’s not a shooting lunch. Give them some champagne first and that will allow you the time to set it out properly.

ALFRED
I’ll manage, Mr Carson. What’s this place we’re visiting?

MR CARSON
It’s one of His Lordship’s houses, though I’m curious as to why they’re going there today.

ALFRED
Maybe he likes to keep a check on things.

MR CARSON
Maybe.

[The family talks as they exit the house. Matthew and Mary exit first, followed by, Edith, then Robert and Cora.]

MATTHEW
We’ll see you there.

[Carson waves a hand at Alfred.]

MR CARSON
Off you go.

[Alfred goes to open Matthew’s car door.]

ROBERT
Mrs Banning; she was a cousin of Granny’s.

MARY
You want to come with us?

EDITH
Yes, thank you.

MR CARSON
Might I have a word, my lady?

CORA
Yes, of course. What is it?

[Robert gets in the second car.]

MR CARSON
This is a slightly awkward request, what with the wedding tomorrow.

CORA
Tell me.

MR CARSON
Mrs Hughes is very tired. I—I wonder if it might be possible for you to divert some of her work my way.

CORA
I don’t understand. What do you mean “tired”?

[Carson looks away awkwardly. Robert calls from the car.]

ROBERT
Cora?

[Cora puts a hand up for him to wait without looking at him.]

CORA
Carson?

MR CARSON
The fact is, Mrs Hughes is ill, my lady.

[Cora is very concerned.]

MR CARSON
She may be very ill. I’m extremely sorry to trouble you with this at such a moment, but I don’t want the wedding to sink her.

CORA
Of course not. But, my heavens, how will we manage without O’Brien, and now Mrs Hughes?

[Carson is confused.]

MR CARSON
Miss O’Brien?

CORA
She told Molesley—

ROBERT
Cora, please.

[Cora looks at Robert in the car, then hesitates looking back to Carson, and then goes to the car.]

CORA
I’m coming.

[Cora steps in and Carson closes the door and watches them all drive off.]

--
[13:16, EXT. LONDON STREET – DAY]
[Anna turns into a residential area where a woman is taking laundry off the line.]

ANNA
Mrs Bartlett? I’ve...I’ve brought the money.

[Anna gives Mrs Bartlett some money. Bartlett checks it and sticks it in her pocket.]

MRS BARTLETT
Well, it’s you’re loss ‘cause I got nothing to say.

[Bartlett goes about her laundry.]

ANNA
All I want to know is if Vera—

MRS BARTLETT
Oh! So you were on Christian name terms, were you? You do surprise me.

[Anna pauses, then composes herself.]

ANNA
If Mrs Bates ever suggested she was depressed or unhappy.

MRS BARTLETT
Of course she was unhappy. Her husband had left her and gone off with a trollop.

[Anna takes a couple steps and stares at Bartlett’s back.]

MRS BARTLETT
He changed, you know. She was scared of him by the end and now he knows she had good reason.

ANNA
When did you last see her?

[Bartlett looks over at the other women trying to listen in as they take down their laundry.]

MRS BARTLETT
You better come inside.

--
[14:27, EXT. PRISON, EXERCISE YARD – DAY]
[The guards have the men walk in a circle around the yard. The man walking behind Bates whispers to him surreptitiously.]

DENT
Bates. Pfft. Watch out.

BATES
What do you mean?

DENT
Search your room. Search your bed. They’ve set you up somehow, your cellmate, Craig and his mates.

GUARD
Stop talking!

DENT
Just do it.

--
[14:54, INT. MRS BARTLETT’S HOUSE - DAY]

MRS BARTLETT
Their door was open, so I looked in. She was cooking, but...she had to post a letter, so she walked me down the street. She said Bates was coming back later for his tea. She was terrified. She was in a strange mood. Jumpy and fearful, but determined. I remember she had made pastry and she was scrubbing it out of her nails like she didn’t care if she took the skin off.

ANNA
So, after she posted the letter, she went home on her own?

MRS BARTLETT
She did, poor soul. And I never saw her after.

[Mrs Bartlett sits down at the table with Anna.]

MRS BARTLETT
I can remember her now, walking away down the street. It was raining. No. Not raining, more like drizzle. And the gas light seemed to catch in the drops and make a sort of halo around her.

ANNA
A halo? Really?

MRS BARTLETT
You can laugh.

ANNA
When did you hear she was dead.

MRS BARTLETT
Next day. So I knew it was Bates. When I heard the verdict, I thought he’d swing. And he should have if the country hadn’t gone soft.

[Mrs Bartlett starts crying.]

--
[16:08, EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY]
[Violet sits in the back of a Strallan’s motorcar as Isobel sits up front with the chauffeur.]

VIOLET
This is very good of you.

SIR ANTHONY
Nonsense, you were on the way. (to Isobel) I do wish you’d let me sit in the front.

ISOBEL
No, no. I prefer it. I’ve ridden in the front seat many times.

VIOLET
Aren’t you a wild thing.

SIR ANTHONY
Oh, it’s quite safe. There’s never been a safer method of travel.

VIOLET
Or a faster one.

SIR ANTHONY
Edith’s a speed fiend. She likes to go at a terrific lick.

VIOLET
Do you think you’ll be able to keep up with her?

SIR ANTHONY
I’ll try.

ISOBEL
What’s this place like? [?], is it? Do you know it?

VIOLET
Well, a little. My late husband kept the shooting there and we sometimes had luncheon in the house.

ISOBEL
Is it nice?

VIOLET
Nice enough, as a retreat from the world. I wouldn’t have thought it suited to much else.

--
[16:54, EXT. ? BACKYARD – DAY]
[Tables are set for luncheon on the grounds. A large house sits in the background. Cora looks at it fondly.]

CORA
Downton Place.

[Robert does not look at the house with any enthusiasm.]

CORA
How lovely.

[Robert walks away glumly.]

MARY
Won’t it be a bit cramped?

TOM
You do realise that for most people it looks like a fairy palace.

SYBIL
You’ll be able to run it with a much smaller staff.

ROBERT
This is it. I doubt we’ll need more than eight servants, tops. So it’ll be very economical. A—

[Robert puts a finger over his lips as Alfred steps forward to place something on the table, then steps away.]

VIOLET
What about me? Where am I to go?

ROBERT
We still own most of the village.

VIOLET
Oh. Perhaps I could open a shop.

[Edith chuckles.]

EDITH
Good idea, Granny. What do you think [?] needs?

VIOLET
Well, if it’s like everywhere else: good manners and some decent conversation.

ISOBEL
Well, there you are then. You should have a roaring trade in minutes.

[Edith chuckle.]

ISOBEL
How’s everything going?

EDITH
Very well, I think.

ISOBEL
I think it’s rather unfair that Mary should have an archbishop to marry her and you’ve got poor old Mr Travis.

EDITH
Oh, I don’t mind. It was such short notice and he was all booked up. And I prefer it, really, to have the man that christened us.

--
[18:02, EXT. FRONT YARD – DAY]
[Mary and Matthew walk together.]

MARY
What did Charkham come for?

MATTHEW
He gave me a letter from Swire. It seems he left one for each of the three potential heirs when and if they inherited. Mine is the only one to have been delivered.

MARY
And what did it say?

MATTHEW
I haven’t opened it. I can’t decide whether I will.

MARY
Why wouldn’t you?

MATTHEW
Because I know it’ll be a paean of praise. How Lavinia could not have found a better man, et cetera.

MARY
And you don’t want to read that?

MATTHEW
Since she could not have found a worse one, no, I don’t. I already feel bad enough, and if I read his words, they will stay with me forever.

[Matthew walks off and Mary stares after him with a confused scowl.]

--
[18:44, INT. SERVANTS’ CORRIDOR – DAY]
[Isobel walks down the stairs and searches the corridor. She finds Mrs Hughes, who is rather surprised to see her.]

ISOBEL
Ah.

MRS HUGHES
Mrs Crawley.

ISOBEL
We’re back from our delicious luncheon. And, erm, I was on my way home. You had a maid at Downton, Ethel Parks. I was here when she brought her son into the dining room.

MRS HUGHES
Who could forget that?

ISOBEL
Do you have an address for her?

MRS HUGHES
I do. If she’s still there.

ISOBEL
You see...

[Another servant walks by and Isobel stops talking until the girl passes. She continues in a lowered voice.]

ISOBEL
You see, I saw her this morning. And I’m afraid she’s fallen into a bad way. A very bad way.

MRS HUGHES
Oh, dear. I am sorry to hear that. If you’d like to come with me, I’ll fetch it for you.

ISOBEL
Thank you.

--
[19:32, INT. PRISON, BATES’S CELL – DAY]
[Craig sits on his bed while Bates searches the bed underneath for planted evidence. Guards walk down the outside corridor. Bates finds something under his mattress. The guards approach his cell and he hears their keys jangle in the lock. The guards enter.]

DURRANT
Get up, both of you! Against the wall.

[Craig and Bates comply.]

DURRANT
Mr Turner, search the bunk, please.

[The other guard searches the bed, smelling the pillow. Bates moves his hand along the wall, holding what he found.]

TURNER
Nothing here.

DURRANT
What?

[The guard searches where Bates found the object, but it’s not there. The guard seems to think for a moment, then stalks out.]

DURRANT
Clean this mess up!

[Craig walks back to his untidy bed and shoves the mattress back toward the wall.]

CRAIG
Bastards.

[Bates watches Craig with a slight glare. He steps away from the wall, which now has a tiny fringe of cloth poking out of a crack between the stones.]

BATES
There’s a lot of bastards in here.

[Bates walks menacingly toward the bunk, then sits down on his bed.]

--
[20:50, INT. SERVANTS’ HALL - DAY]
[The servants sit down to their luncheon. Molesley turns to Anna.]

MR MOLESLEY
I expect you’re tired. It’s a long day up to London and back again.

MRS HUGHES
Was it worth the journey?

ANNA
Not really.

MR CARSON
Miss O’Brien, might I ask what you’ve confided in Mr Molesley, but have kept from the rest of us.

O’BRIEN
I don’t know what you mean.

MR CARSON
Mr Molesley appears to have given Her Ladyship the impression that you’re planning a change of some sort.

[O’Brien turns to Molesley.]

O’BRIEN
What’s this?

MR MOLESLEY
I—I’m sorry. I thought Her Ladyship would know.

O’BRIEN
Know what?

MR MOLESLEY
That you’re leaving.

[O’Brien looks offended.]

O’BRIEN
I beg your pardon? How dare you make such an assumption!

[Thomas watches the exchange and Mrs Hughes looks between O’Brien and Molesley.]

THOMAS
Isn’t it time for the dressing gong, Mr Carson?

MR CARSON
Oh, it certainly is. Thank you.

[Mr Molesley tries to ask Thomas about the confusion as all the servants rise from the table.]

THOMAS
Excuse me, Mr Molesley, but I’ve got work to do, even if you haven’t.

[O’Brien glares at Thomas, then at Molesley.]

O’BRIEN
I’ll deal with you later.

[O’Brien leaves. Molesley looks surprised and a little worried. Daisy stares at him as she’s clearing the table.]

DAISY
You’re in the soup. I wouldn’t be in her bad books for a gold clock.

[Daisy exits and Molesley is left alone in the servants’ hall looking a bit stunned.]

--
[21:56, INT. LADY GRANTHAM’S BEDROOM – EVENING]

CORA
You must have said something Molesley misinterpreted.

O’BRIEN
But I don’t say anything to him, milady, beyond “pass the salt” and “get out of the way.”

CORA
There must have been something. I’m afraid I do feel let down, O’Brien. I really do. And right on top of the wedding...

[Someone knocks on the door, and Mrs Hughes enters.]

MRS HUGHES
You sent for me, milady?

CORA
Yes.

[Cora turns to O’Brien.]

CORA
Thank you, O’Brien.

[Mrs Hughes lowers her gaze with a displeased expression as O’Brien passes her, and then looks up pleasantly at Cora as O’Brien shuts the door on her way out.]

CORA
Mrs Hughes, I understand that you’re not well.

[Mrs Hughes is taken by surprise.]

MRS HUGHES
Whom do you...understand that from? Because...if the doctor—

CORA
It wasn’t Doctor Clarkson.

MRS HUGHES
It is not confirmed that I am ill, Your Ladyship. I’ve had a test, and I’m waiting for the results. But I am perfectly capable—

CORA
Mrs Hughes, I only want to say one thing, that if you are ill, you are welcome here for as long as you want to stay.

[Mrs Hughes stares at Cora, speechless.]

CORA
Lady Sybil will help us to find a suitable nurse.

MRS HUGHES
I see.

CORA
I don’t want you to have any concerns about where you’ll go or who’ll look after you, because the answer is here, and we will.

[Mrs Hughes is speechless and slightly emotional.]

MRS HUGHES
I don’t know what to say, milady.

CORA
There isn’t anything more to say until we know where we stand, one way or the other.

MRS HUGHES
Thank you.

--
[23:17, INT. DRAWING ROOM – EVENING]

EDITH
He thinks I don’t know, but of course I do. We’ll spend two weeks in Rome, then Florence, then Venice. So, I couldn’t be happier.

[Edith smiths happily.]

SYBIL
And what about Locksley? Is there masses to be done?

EDITH
It’s not too bad.

MARY
It’s not too bad downstairs. The bedrooms are killers.

ISOBEL
Well, don’t do anything too fast. It takes time to know how a house works.

[Edith smiles excitedly, and Sybil smiles with her.]

VIOLET
I really think you should go to bed. No bride wants to look tired at her wedding. It either means she’s anxious or she’s been up to no good.

[Edith sighs happily.]

EDITH
I won’t sleep a wink.

SYBIL
Tonight or tomorrow?

VIOLET
Sybil, vulgarity is no substitute for wit.

[Edith chuckles.]

SYBIL
Well, you started it.

--
[23:58, INT. SERVANTS’ CORRIDOR - EVENING]
[O’Brien descends the stairs quickly and Molesley anxiously calls to her.]

MR MOLESLEY
Miss O’Brien, please understand I didn’t mean any harm.

O’BRIEN
Well, why make it up in the first place?

MR MOLESLEY
I didn’t make it up, I was told.

O’BRIEN
Who told you?

MR MOLESLEY
Well...Mr Barrow mentioned it, but I think it was an honest mistake.

O’BRIEN
No. It wasn’t honest, and it wasn’t a mistake. But don’t worry about it, I can tell it wasn’t your fault, Mr Molesley. So we’ll forget about it, shall we?

[Molesley nods and starts to go into the servants’ hall, but he stops when O’Brien continues talking.]

O’BRIEN
And when you see Mr Barrow, you can tell him that I may make some honest mistakes myself in the future.

[O’Brien enters the hall and Molesley stares after her in surprise. The servants stand around the table waiting for Carson to sit. He sits and they join him. O’Brien gives Thomas a dark look. Alfred sees Daisy standing at the table.]

ALFRED
Why not sit down and eat with us?

DAISY
Oh, I couldn’t do that.

MR CARSON
Daisy will not sit down because the invitation is not in your gift, Alfred. She eats with Mrs Patmore in the kitchen.

[Alfred looks at Daisy and she turns to leave.]

ALFRED
Fancy a game or something later?

[Daisy and Mrs Patmore stop on their way out.]

MRS PATMORE
Oh, Daisy’s busy.

ALFRED
Anna?

ANNA
I want to write a letter. Sorry.

MR MOLESLEY
I’ll play.

ALFRED
Let’s see how I feel.

[Molesley’s smile fades.]

--
[25:08, INT. MARY AND MATTHEW’S BEDROOM - NIGHT]
[Mary and Matthew are arguing in their pyjamas.]

MATTHEW
What do you mean you’ve read it?

MARY
I didn’t think it was right to destroy a man’s last words without reading them. I felt it was wrong.

MATTHEW
It wasn’t your decision!

MARY
Well, I made it my decision! Do you want to hear what he says?

MATTHEW
No.

MARY
To start with, Lavinia must have written to him on her last day, only hours before she died.

MATTHEW
Well, that’s nonsense. There was no letter found in her room.

MARY
Be that as it may, she wrote to him after she tried to persuade you to call off the wedding and you wouldn’t.

MATTHEW
This is quite impossible.

[Mary scoffs and pulls the letter out from under her pillow, opening it.]

MARY
“She loved and admired you for this sacrifice of your own happiness and she commended you to my care.”

MATTHEW
I can’t listen to any more of this.

[Matthew turns around.]

MARY
You must. “I have few intimates, and so I’ve decided, in her name, to add you to my list of heirs.”

[Matthew listens impatiently with his back to Mary.]

MARY
“I think it unlikely that I’ll outlive both the first two, so there is little chance of your reading this letter, but if you do, and if the money has come to you, know it is with my full knowledge of what transpired. Please do not allow any grief, guilt, or regret to hold you back in its employment. God bless you, my boy. Reggie.”

[Matthew is still unhappy and unsure. He turns to look at Mary, who is staring at him expectantly.]

MATTHEW
You sure you didn’t write it.

MARY
I assume you know his hand.

MATTHEW
Not well enough to test a forgery.

[Matthew takes off his robe angrily, preparing for bed. Mary stares at him in shock, then looks away.]

MATTHEW
Besides, she couldn’t’ have written to him without our knowing.

[Mary just stares at the bed and Matthew’s anger abates some.]

MATTHEW
I’m not accusing you of faking it.

[Matthew sits down to remove his slippers.]

MATTHEW
But I suspect someone has.

[Mary looks up at Matthew in disbelief.]

MARY
So it won’t change your mind?

[Matthew thinks for a moment, then pulls the covers up roughly.]

MATTHEW
Not yet it won’t.

[Mary looks away, then tosses the letter on the bed in irritation.]

--
[26:46, INT. MRS HUGHES’S SITTING ROOM – NIGHT]
[Carson knocks at the door and enters as Mrs Hughes is writing at her desk.]

MR CARSON
Time you were in bed. It’s a big day tomorrow.

MRS HUGHES
I’ll just finish this.

MR CARSON
Is there something I can do for you?

[Mrs Hughes shakes her head as she continues writing.]

MRS HUGHES
No.

[Mrs Hughes pauses for a moment as Carson turns to leave. She turns around.]

MRS HUGHES
Did you...say anything about me to Her Ladyship?

[Carson hesitates.]

MR CARSON
I don’t know what you mean. Why?

MRS HUGHES
Don’t worry. She was very kind and...I was touched. As you know, I don’t worship them all, like you do.

MR CARSON
I wouldn’t put it like that.

MRS HUGHES
But this time...I freely admit it. (voice breaking) I was quite touched.

[Mrs Hughes turns back to her desk and Carson exits.]

--
[27:45, INT. SERVANTS’ HALL – MORNING]
[Mary enters while the servants are eating.]

MARY
Am I interrupting?

[The servants all stand.]

MARY
No. Please. I just want to ask you all something.

ANNA
Milady, I’m sorry I’ve not been up.

MARY
Don’t worry. I’ll change properly after luncheon. But I had to catch you when you were all together.

MR CARSON
How can we help, my lady?

MARY
It’s a funny thing. Mr Crawley has heard that Miss Swire sent a letter on the day she died. If so, someone must have posted it for her, and we wondered if it were any of you.

[The servants all look at each other, but no one speaks up.]

MR CARSON
I’m afraid not. Given that the poor lady passed away that same day, an incident of this sort would have been reported to me or Mrs Hughes.

MRS HUGHES
That’s right, milady.

MARY
I see. Well, thank you very much.

[Mary turns to leave and the servants sit just as Daisy enters with tray.]

DAISY
What were that about?

ANNA
Lady Mary wanted to know if anyone posted a letter for Miss Swire.

DAISY
Oh, I did that.

MR CARSON
Daisy? What did you say?

[Mary re-enters and the servants stand back up.]

DAISY
Poor Miss Swire’s letter. She’d written it and she asked me to put it into the box in the hall.

[Daisy turns to the stunned looking Mary.]

DAISY
Why?

MRS HUGHES
What were you doing in her room?

Making up the fire. We started talking and she said she’d written a letter. She was ever so nice. I still get sad when I think about her.

MRS HUGHES
And it didn’t occur to you to tell me?

DAISY
Tell you what?

MARY
Never mind. I am grateful to you, Daisy. You cannot know how much.

[Mary smiles at Daisy.]

--
[29:15, INT. LIBRARY - DAY]

VIOLET
Well, this is the last of them.

ROBERT
I’m glad they’ve hurried it, so she can be married from Downton.

VIOLET
Are you? I should’ve thought a little sober reflection would not have gone amiss.

[Robert checks his pocket watch.]

ROBERT
Mamma, let’s try to be positive. Of all of them, Anthony Strallan is the most traditional choice.

VIOLET
Robert…Edith is beginning her life as an old man’s drudge. I should not have thought a large drawing room much compensation.

ROBERT
Why dwell on that now ?

VIOLET
Because I want the pleasure of saying, “I told you so.”

[Robert turns sharply and looks at her.]

--
[29:49, INT. MRS HUGHES’S SITTING ROOM - DAY]
[Carson and Mrs Patmore follow Mrs Hughes into her sitting room.]

MR CARSON
Now, the moment you feel tired, you’re to tell me, and I’ll take over whatever it is you’re doing.

MRS PATMORE
Oh, will you now?

MRS HUGHES
Are you sure you want to come to the church? You could stay here and have a lie down.

[Mrs Hughes purses her lips, holding in her anger.]

MRS HUGHES
It would be so nice if people would wait to learn if I really am ill before boxing me up.

[Mrs Hughes puts on her coat.]

MR CARSON
I don’t know what you mean. I don’t know anything about any illness.

MRS HUGHES
Don’t you? I see.

[Carson clears his throat and exits.]

MRS HUGHES
Who told him?

MRS PATMORE
I don’t know. Maybe he just picked it up somehow. Erm, he’s worried about you. He’s a good man.

MRS HUGHES
He’s a hopeless liar.

MRS PATMORE
Well, that’s quite nice really, i'n’t it?

MRS HUGHES
I’ve had a message from the doctor. He’ll have the results tomorrow. I’m to call in the afternoon.

[Mrs Patmore nods.]

MRS PATMORE
Try not to worry.

MRS HUGHES (sigh)
I’ll try, but I won’t succeed.

[Mrs Hughes leaves. Mrs Patmore gives a worried sigh before following.]

--
[30:59, INT. MARY AND MATTHEW’S BEDROOM – DAY]
[Mary looks at her appearance in the mirror. Matthew enters and Mary turns to Anna.]

MARY
That’s it. I’ll put the hat on later. Go straight to Lady Edith.

[Matthew looks Mary over. He’s already dressed in his mourning coat.]

MATTHEW
You look marvellous.

MARY
I feel marvellous. That is, I feel marvellous because we don’t have to leave Downton. Lavinia did write to her father...

[Matthew’s expression falls.]

MARY
And it was posted from his house.

[Matthew’s gloom disappears with curiosity.]

MARY
In other words, every word Mr Swire wrote in that letter was true.

[Matthew takes a breath and sinks into a chair to process this news.]

MARY
Daisy posted it. The kitchen maid.

[Matthew becomes a bit emotional.]

MATTHEW
I see.

MARY
Do you, my darling? I hope so. Because if you try to find one more excuse not to accept the money, I’ll have to beat you about the head.

[Matthew’s overwhelmed mood disappears with chuckling. Mary smiles down at him.]

MATTHEW
I see.

[Matthew takes another breath.]

MATTHEW
I do have one condition, however.

MARY
Make it a good one.

MATTHEW
Let’s not steal Edith’s thunder. I’ll tell Robert after it’s over and she’s left on honeymoon.

[Mary smiles with happy relief.]

MARY
Now that I can live with.

[Matthew begins to smile. He stands up and they kiss each other on the cheek.]

--
[32:13, INT. LADY EDITH’S BEDROOM – DAY]

CORA
You look beautiful.

[Edith sighs happily.]

EDITH
All of us married.

[Edith turns to look at her sisters.]

EDITH
All of us happy.

[Edith looks at Sybil.]

EDITH
And the first baby on the way. Why don’t we get the photographer to take a picture of the three of us…when we get to the church?

--
[32:34, INT. DOWNTON CHURCH – DAY]
[Strallan looks pale and nervous as he stands at the altar.]

VIOLET
He looks as if he’s waiting for a beating from the headmaster.

REVEREND TRAVIS
Do you think I should reassure him?

VIOLET
How? He’s done it before, so he must be in possession of all the facts.

REVEREND TRAVIS
Perhaps the first Lady Strallan was a difficult act to follow.

VIOLET
Or a difficult one to repeat.

--
[32:55, EXT. DOWNTON CHURCH – DAY]
[The photographer takes a photo of the sisters together in front of the church. Robert hurries forward, looking at his pocket watch.]

ROBERT

Well, fashionably late is one thing.

MARY
We’re going in. Edith, I know we haven’t always got along, and I doubt things change much in the future, but today, I wish you all the luck in the world.

[Edith smiles.]

EDITH
Thank you.

[Mary kisses Edith on the cheek and goes inside. Edith takes a quick breath and Anna helps her with her train as she takes her father’s arm.]

--
[33:28, INT. DOWNTON CHURCH – DAY]
[Mary and Sybil walk to their pew. Robert hands his hat to an usher inside.]

ROBERT
Thank you.

USHER
Very good.

[Mary and Sybil take their places and the guests stand at the organ begins to play. Edith and Robert begin to walk down the aisle and Strallan steps up to the altar with a grim look on his face. Cora smiles as Edith passes her. Edith steps up beside him all smiles.]

EDITH (whisper)
Good afternoon.

SIR ANTHONY (whisper)
Good afternoon, my sweet one.

[Strallan gives her a small smile. The guests watch with pleasant smiles. The music stops.]

REVEREND TRAVIS
Dearly beloved, we are gathered—

[Strallan looks up at the minister.]

SIR ANTHONY
I can’t do this.

[Edith and Robert turn suddenly to Strallan and the guests murmur.]

ROBERT (sharp whisper)
What?

[Strallan looks down at Edith.]

SIR ANTHONY
I can’t do it.

[Edith’s smile fades. Strallan looks at Robert.]

SIR ANTHONY
You know it’s wrong. You told me so yourself several times.

ROBERT
My dear chap.

SIR ANTHONY
No. I never should have let it get this far. I should have stopped it long ago. I tried to stop it.

EDITH
What are you saying? I don’t understand what you’re saying.

SIR ANTHONY
Edith...

[Strallan looks at the guests who are staring in shock. Strallan turns back to Edith in a lower voice.]

SIR ANTHONY
Edith, I can’t let you throw away your life like this.

EDITH
What do you mean? We’re so happy, aren’t we?

[Edith takes Strallan’s hand.]

EDITH
We’re going to be...so terribly, terribly happy.

SIR ANTHONY
But you are going to be happy. I pray that you are. But only if you don’t waste yourself on me.

[Edith looks into Strallan's eyes, mortified.]

ROBERT
Anthony, it is too late for this.

REVEREND TRAVIS
Might I suggest we all take a step back?

[Violet steps forward to Edith.]

VIOLET
No. Let him go. Let him go. You know he’s right.

[Edith looks up at Strallan, her lip trembling.]

VIOLET
Don’t stop him doing the only sensible thing he’s come up with in months.

SIR ANTHONY
Thank you, Lady Grantham.

EDITH
But...Granny...

VIOLET
No, no. It’s over, my dear. Don’t drag it out. Wish him well and let him go.

EDITH
I can’t.

[Edith is becoming more upset by the moment.]

SIR ANTHONY
Goodbye, my dearest darling. And may God bless you.

[Strallan leans close to her ear.]

SIR ANTHONY
Always.

[Strallan walks back up the aisle and Edith turns to him, but Violet holds her back.]

VIOLET
No. [?] sweetheart.

[The guests watch him leave. Mrs Hughes and Carson give him dark looks as he passes them. Cora and Violet lead Edith to the side door. The rest of the family reels from the shock, Sybil close to tears.]

--
[35:58, EXT. DOWNTON CHURH – DAY]
[Strallan walks quickly away from the church, ghastly pale and very upset. He passes the chauffeurs standing at the car.]

CHAUFFEUR
Oh, look lively.

[The chauffeurs put on their hats and stand by. Strallan walks past the cars and continues on.]

--
[36:10, INT. GREAT HALL – DAY]
[Edith re-enters the house, crying in her wedding gown. Alfred turns around from pouring champagne and sees her retreating figure on the stairs. The rest of the family follows, the sisters going after Edith. Edith throws her veil over the stairs.]

--
[36:30, INT. LADY EDITH’S BEDROOM – DAY]
[Edith walks in and goes straight to the bed to cry. She pulls the laurel tiara out of her hair and flops over on the bed in tears.]

--
[36:41, INT. GREAT HALL – DAY]
[Robert, Tom, and Matthew stand in the hall with Alfred.]

ROBERT
When everyone gets back, can you clear all this away? I want it gone before Lady Edith comes downstairs, flowers, glasses, everything. And ask the outside staff to help put back the carpet and the furniture.

ALFRED
Yes, milord.

--
[36:54, INT. LADY EDITH’S BEDROOM – DAY]
[Cora, Mary, and Sybil enter to find Edith crying on the bed.]

CORA
Is there anything I could say to make it better?

EDITH
No.

[Edith sits up and Cora sits next to her on the bed. Edith looks at her sisters.]

EDITH
Look at them. Both with their husbands. Sybil pregnant, Mary probably pregnant.

[Sybil is crying.]

EDITH
Oh, just go. I mean it, go!

CORA
Perhaps you should go.

[The sisters leave. Edith flops back on the bed with a new bout of tears. Cora leans over her and covers her hands with her own.]

EDITH
Oh, Mamma.

CORA
You are being tested. And do you know what they say, my darling? Being tested only makes you stronger.

[Edith shakes her head.]

EDITH
I don’t think it’s working with me.

[Edith cries more.]

--
[37:48, INT. GREAT HALL – DAY]
[The servants clear away the champagne, the cake, the flowers, and re-lay the carpet in the great hall.]

--
[38:04, EXT. DOWNTON GROUNDS – DAY]
[Robert walks across the grounds just outside the library, hands clasped behind his back, lost in thought. Matthew joins him.]

MATTHEW
What should we do now?

ROBERT
There’s nothing we can do, beyond removing all signs of a wedding and holding her hand while she recovers. She will, of course.

[Matthew nods. Robert turns to look at the house.]

ROBERT
Meanwhile, it’s time to face the business of leaving Downton. Without the wedding to hide behind, there’s no reason not to get on with it, and astonish the world with the extent of my wretched failure.

MATTHEW
Actually...Mary and I intended to make an announcement...at dinner.

ROBERT
What announcement? What about?

MATTHEW
You don’t have to leave.

[Robert looks at Matthew in confusion.]

MATTHEW
I’ll explain it later, but...I’m going to give you Reggie’s money. I’ll accept it. And I’ll give it to you.

[Robert stares at Matthew. He processes the offer for a moment with furrowed brows.]

ROBERT
Don’t be silly. You’re not going to give me any money.

MATTHEW
But I am. You don’t want to leave. Nor does Mary. Nor do any of us, for that matter.

ROBERT
I still won’t take your money.

[The gentlemen stand there for a moment and Robert looks up at the house.]

ROBERT
What I will allow is for you to invest in the place. If we stay, you’ll share the ownership. It’ll be your house, your estate, as much as mine. We will be joint masters.

MATTHEW
But...

ROBERT
And if you won’t agree, I will sell, and it’ll all be your fault.

[Matthew holds his breath for a moment, not entirely sure about the arrangement. Then he exhales with a smile. They shake hands affectionately.]

--
[40:07, INT. KITCHENS – EVENING]

DAISY
I never thought I’d feel sorry for an earl’s daughter.

ANNA
All God’s creatures have their troubles.

[Anna and Daisy take the wedding food off the serving trays.]

DAISY
Anna?

ANNA
Yes.

DAISY
Do you think it’s right that...women should say what they think? Speak out about romance and everything?

ANNA
Well...things are changing for us, and the vote won’t be long now. So I suppose they must get used to us speaking our minds, but...

DAISY
But what?

ANNA
With most of the men I’ve ever met, if you started to court them, they’d be so terrified, they’d run a mile.

[Alfred enters and grabs something from a tray. He crunches on it as he exits and Daisy watches him with a slight smile. Anna smiles at Daisy knowingly.]

--
[40:55, INT. DINING ROOM – EVENING]
[Dinner is very quiet.]

ISOBEL
Has she had something to eat?

MARY
Anna took up some sandwiches, but she didn’t touch a thing.

CORA
That reminds me. Carson, I don’t want Lady Edith to see any of the wedding food.

MR CARSON
Mrs Hughes and Anna are taking what’s left down to Mr Travis tomorrow, my lady, for the poor.

VIOLET
If the poor don’t want it, you can bring it over to me.

[Mary looks up at her grandmother in surprise.]

MATTHEW
How can we help Edith?

ISOBEL
You can help her by finding her something to do.

[Matthew’s mouth twitches upward.]

--
[41:30, INT. SERVANTS’ HALL – EVENING]
[The wedding delicacies fill the table.]

ALFRED
Is this all we’re getting? Just these pickety bits?

THOMAS
Hardly. These are canapés, Alfred. For your first course, some truffled egg on toast, perhaps. Some oysters à la Russe.

ALFRED
Then what?

MRS PATMORE
There’s lobster [?] in [?] sauce. Or Calvados glazed duckling. Or do you fancy a little asparagus salad with champagne saffron vinaigrette?

MRS HUGHES
When I think how you’ve gone to such pains.

MRS PATMORE
Never mind me. What about the pain of that poor girl upstairs?

O’BRIEN
Jilted at the altar. I don’t think I could stand the shame.

THOMAS
Then it’s lucky no one’s ever asked you, isn’t it?

[O’Brien just looks down.]

ANNA
Poor thing. How will she find the strength to hold up her head?

DAISY
I swear, I’d have to run away and hide in a place where no one knew me.

ALFRED
I think she’s well out of it.

MR MOLESLEY
How can you say that?

ALFRED
I mean it. She’s young, she’s not bad looking. She could do much better than that broken down old crock.

MR CARSON
Sir Anthony may have betrayed a daughter of this house, but he still does not deserve to be addressed in that manner by a footman.

MRS HUGHES
Oh, I think he does, Mr Carson. Every bit of that. And worse.

MR CARSON
Well, maybe just this once.

MRS PATMORE
Right. What’s it to be? Lobster, duck, or asparagus?

ALFRED
Is there any cheese, Mrs Patmore?

[Mrs Patmore’s jaw drops at Alfred’s crazy request. Carson purses his lips.]

--
[42:52, INT. LADY EDITH’S BEDROOM – MORNING]
[Anna enters. She picks up Edith’s laurel tiara from the floor. Edith is lying in bed.]

ANNA
What would you like me to get you?

EDITH
A different life.

ANNA
Let me bring you up some breakfast.

EDITH
No.

[Edith sits up.]

EDITH
I’m a useful spinster...good at helping out. That is my role. And spinsters get up for breakfast.

[Edith gets out of bed and Anna watches her sadly.]

--
[43:34, INT. MRS HUGHES’S SITTING ROOM – DAY]
[Mrs Hughes buttons her coat. Carson knocks and enters.]

MR CARSON
Going out?

MRS HUGHES
Just into the village. I...have to fetch something.

MR CARSON
Can I help? I’m going down later.

MRS HUGHES (shakes her head)
Thank you. This is an errand I have to do for myself.

[Mrs Patmore enters.]

MRS PATMORE
Ready?

MR CARSON
MRS HUGHES
As ready as I’ll ever be.

[Mrs Hughes braces herself, takes her purse and Mrs Patmore follows her out. Carson watches them leave with concern.]

--
[44:22, EXT. DOWTON COTTAGE HOSPITAL – DAY]
[Mrs Hughes stands stiffly, staring at the hospital across the street; Mrs Patmore waits next to her.]

MRS HUGHES
We can be sure of one thing. I won’t be cured by standing here.

[Mrs Hughes walks forward and Mrs Patmore follows.]

--
[44:45, INT. MR CARSON’S OFFICE – DAY]
[Carson begins preparations for dinner, but he’s distracted. He checks his pocket watch.]

--
[44:58, INT. DOWTON COTTAGE HOSPITAL, WAITING ROOM – DAY]
[Mrs Patmore and Mrs Hughes wait for the doctor. The nurse opens the door.]

MRS PATMORE
Do y—

MRS HUGHES
No.

[Mrs Hughes stands up and Mrs Patmore nods.]

--
[45:22, INT. SERVANTS’ CORRIDOR – EVENING]
[Thomas sees O’Brien walking toward him.]

THOMAS
Everything all right, Miss O’Brien?

[O’Brien stops entering the kitchen and approaches him.]

O’BRIEN
Oh, yes. Everything’s all right with me. But it’ll be all wrong with you before too long, mark my words.

THOMAS
Oh? And how is that, Miss O’Brien?

O’BRIEN
I don’t know. Not yet. But it will be. You can be sure of it.

[Thomas watches O’Brien exit, slightly disturbed by her threats.]

--
[45:57, INT. KITCHENS – EVENING]
[Mr Carson walks up to Mrs Patmore, who’s still in her coat and hat.]

MR CARSON
Well?

[Mrs Patmore waits for an explanation.]

MR CARSON
Is it or isn’t it?

MRS PATMORE
It’s not cancer. No. It’s a benign something or other, nothing more.

[Carson sighs with relief, then pauses secretively.]

MR CARSON
Don’t mention that you’ve said anything. She doesn’t know that I know.

MRS PATMORE
I won’t say a word.

[Carson tries to exit stealthily. Mrs Patmore holds in her laughter with a smile. Mrs Hughes tip toes in behind her.]

MRS HUGHES
Did you tell him?

MRS PATMORE
I would prefer to say, I put him out of his misery.
