MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Am I ready?

WILLIAM
Only you can answer that, sir.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
They're going to chuck everything they've got at us.

WILLIAM
Then we shall have to chuck it back, won't we, sir?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Quite right.

[Matthew grabs his helmet and they head out. The men in the trenches read letters from home, smoke, and pray.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Now, there's no point pretending this is going to be easy!

[Matthew turns to a soldier standing next to him.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
How are you, Thompson? You've shaken that cold?

THOMPSON
I'm all right, sir, thank you.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Good man. We're nearly there, chaps! Just hold fast! Won't be long now.

WAKEFIELD
We're with you, sir.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I know you are, Wakefield. I can't tell you how much lighter that makes the task.

[Matthew holds his watch, waiting as the seconds tick down.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
[?]

OFFICER
Make bayonets!

[The soldiers pull out the bayonets and fix them on their gun barrels. Matthew blows a whistle and the men climb out of the trenches yelling as they charge the enemy. Soldiers fall from gunshots and bombshells.]

--
[INT. DOWNTON, KITCHENS - MORNING]
[Suddenly we're in the Downton kitchens. Daisy stands frozen for a moment at the stove.]

MRS PATMORE
Daisy, what's ever the matter with you?

DAISY
Someone walked over me grave.

[Mrs Patmore rolls her eyes and walks off with a pot.]

--
[The battle continues on the front.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Forward!

--
[INT. DONWTON, LIBRARY - MORNING]
[We're back in the Downton library. Mary swoons and drops her teacup.]

LADY MARY
I'm so sorry.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
What happened?

LADY MARY
I don't know. I suddenly felt terribly cold.

--
[Back at the front, the British continue to advance. Matthew and William briefly find shelter in a dirt crater.]

WILLIAM
I won't be sorry when this one's over!

[They climb out of the crater just as a bombshell flies towards them.]

WILLIAM
Sir!

[William jumps in front of Matthew. The bomb explodes and they fall back into the crater. The troops continue to advance and the Germans surrender. William and Matthew lie unconscious in the crater, William draped over Matthew's legs and torso.]

--
[03:19, INT. LADY GRANTHAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT]
[The door opens into the dark room. O'Brien comes in with a lamp and tugs Cora awake.]

O'BRIEN
My lady. My lady, wake up.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
What on earth?

O'BRIEN
You better come downstairs.

--
[03:31, INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT]

MR MOLESLEY
I didn't know what else to do when I saw the telegram. I knew it was urgent. So, I hope it was right.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Quite right. Mrs Crawley won't mind my opening it. The main thing is, he's not dead. Not yet, anyway. "We have patched him up. They're bringing him to the hospital in Downton."

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
When do they think he'll get here?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
It doesn't say.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
But how do we contact Isobel? And how will she get back?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
One thing at a time. I'll ring the war office in the morning.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Maybe they know she's out there. Perhaps she's with him now.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
They wouldn't have sent a telegram here, and she'd have rung. No, it's the usual bulls—usual mess up, I'm afraid.

MR CARSON
Ahem. Beg pardon, my lord. But we're all very anxious to know the news.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Yes, of course.

[Robert walks over to the door where the servants are gathered.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
It appears that a few days ago, Captain Crawley was wounded. It's serious, I'm afraid, but he's alive and on his way home to the hospital in the village.

MRS HUGHES
Where there's life, there's hope.

DAISY
What about William? Is he all right?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I'll find out what I can tomorrow. I'm not sure there's much more we can do tonight.

MR BATES
William's father would have had a telegram if anything had happened.

LADY EDITH
I'll drive over in the morning.

[Robert nods to Carson and everyone leaves. Mary goes to her father.]

LADY MARY
Whatever you discover, tell me. Don't keep anything back.

[Robert kisses Mary's cheek and she leaves.]

--
[05:08, EXT. COURTYARD - MORNING]
[Anna walks into the courtyard where Bates is shining shoes.]

ANNA
Lady Edith's back. William was caught in it. He's gone to some hospital in Leeds.

MR BATES
I'm very sorry.

ANNA
I might've known. We couldn't be the only household left untouched.

MR BATES
Will he come through it?

ANNA
Her Ladyship said it sounded bad, but we don't know more than that. Can you walk with me to the church this afternoon?

MR BATES
If you want me to.

ANNA
Because I'd like to say a prayer for them. For both of them.

--
[05:49, INT. DOWNTON COTTAGE HOSPITAL - DAY]

DR CLARKSON
We only cater for officers.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Dr Clarkson, I am no Jacobean revolutionary, nor do I seek to overthrow the civilised world. We just need one bed for a young man from this village.

DR CLARKSON
And if it were within my power, you should have it.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Sir, you don't understand. William's father cannot afford to leave his farm and move to Leeds.

DR CLARKSON
I'm very sorry. Really. But this is a military hospital, and it's not up to me to challenge the order of things.

LADY EDITH
I'll nurse him. I'm happy to do it. It wouldn't add to your work load.

DR CLARKSON
If I were to break the rule for you, how many others do you think would come forward to plead for their sons? The answer is, and must be, "no".

[Violet and Edith leave the hospital.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
It always happens. When you give these little people power, it goes to their heads like strong drink.

--
[06:41, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - DAY]

THOMAS
I'm sorry for him. I am. I don't mind Captain Crawley. He's a better man than most of them.

O'BRIEN
And William, too. He's not a bad lad, whatever you say. I wish I'd not written that letter to Bates's wife telling her he's back here.

THOMAS
What's that got to do with it?

O'BRIEN
With everything else going on, I know she'll come up here and make trouble.

THOMAS
Don't blame me, it wasn't my idea.

[Daisy comes in with some food.]

O'BRIEN
Any news?

DAISY
Only that the doctor won't let William come to the village.

O'BRIEN
He never.

DAISY
It's for officers only, he says.

MRS PATMORE
His poor father's staying there with him, spending money he's not got, and travelling miles to do it.

DAISY
It's not right.

THOMAS
No, it bloody well isn't.

[Everyone stares at him.]

THOMAS
Well, I'm a working-class lad and so is he, and I get fed up seeing how our lot always gets shafted.

--
[07:33, INT. LADY MARY'S BEDROOM - DAY]
[Mary rifles through her sewing kit.]

LADY MARY
I thought I'd take some things down to the hospital. Then I can wait and sit with him when he arrives. I've read somewhere that it's very important not to leave them alone when they're first wounded so no sign goes unnoticed. They can't spare a nurse to watch over every man, so that's what I can do.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Your mother's written to Lavinia.

LADY MARY
Good. Yes. I'm glad someone's thought of that. She must stay here and not be at Isobel's by herself.

[Surprised by her composed reaction, Robert regards Mary.]

LADY MARY
What?

[Robert realises his daughter really loves Matthew, enough to accept giving him up to Lavinia.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Nothing.

--
[08:12, INT. CHURCH - DAY]

MR BATES
You should've had a church wedding.

ANNA
Don't be silly.

MR BATES
No, I mean it. You in a white dress, me looking like a fool.

ANNA
I'd rather have the right man that the right wedding.

MR BATES
Well, it won't be long now.

ANNA
How long?

MR BATES
Hard to say. But don't worry, the decree [?] means we're safe. The decree absolute's only formality. I'm just sorry it costs so much.

ANNA
She could've had my shoes and the shirt off my back if it would only make her go away for good.

MR BATES
She's gone now.

ANNA
I suppose I could feel guilty in my happiness, knowing the troubles they're all facing back at home. But, in another way, it only makes me more grateful. Let's pray. Let's pray together.

[They approach and kneel on the bench and hold hands for a moment before they turn to the altar and pray.]

--
[09:34, INT. KITCHENS - DAY]

MRS PATMORE
Don't worry. The old lady'll sort something out now she's got the bit between her teeth.

DAISY
I'm not worried. Not in that way. I feel sorry for William, that's all.

MRS PATMORE
Well, of course you do. We all do. I expect you're glad now that you let him have his little daydream.

DAISY
No, I'm not glad. I feel I've led him up the garden path with all that nonsense, and I'm ashamed. I'm so ashamed.

[Daisy starts to cry.]

MRS PATMORE
Oh. Shh.

[Vera Bates enters.]

VERA BATES
Hello.

MRS PATMORE
Mrs Bates, isn't it? Well, what do you want?

VERA BATES
Don't sound inhospitable, Mrs Patmore, when I've only ever known a welcome in this house.

--
[10:20, INT. OUTER HALL - DAY]
[Violet shouts awkwardly into the telephone.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Yes! Ye-- the minister! Do-- Well, how many Marcuses of Flincher are there? Y-- Wha-- (aside to Edith) Is this an instrument of communication or torture? (into the phone) Well-- Hello? D-- Shrimpy? Y-- It's Aunt Violet! Y-- Very well, very-- Y-- And Susan? Y-- Oh, well g-- good. Good-- I won't beat about the bush, dear. Who might we know on the board of Leeds General Infirmary?

--
[10:58, INT. MRS HUGHES'S SITTING ROOM - DAY]

VERA BATES
Excuse me! It is not settled. It wasn't settled by me that you'd come back here and take up with your floozy again. As far as I recall, that was never settled.

ANNA
How did you find out he was here?

VERA BATES
Wouldn't you like to know.

MR BATES
What does it matter? Just say what you want. Spit it out.

VERA BATES
You thought you got the better of me, but you were wrong.

MR BATES
I never th--

VERA BATES
I'm going to sell my story anyway about Lady Mary, about the Turkish gentleman, about Miss Smith here.

ANNA
That's got nothing to do with me

VERA BATES
Well, that's not what I heard.

MR BATES
You gave your word. I gave you the money and you gave me your word.

VERA BATES
Well, guess what? I was lying.

MR BATES
If I hadn't come back to Downton, back to Anna, would you have stuck to our agreement?

VERA BATES
Well, we'll never know now, will we?

MR BATES
You're angry because I'm happy.

VERA BATES
Maybe. But you won't be happy long.

[Vera leaves.]

--
[11:50, EXT. DOWNTON GARAGE - DAY]

LADY SYBIL
Can you drive me to the hospital?

BRANSON
Aren't you needed here? I've already taken Lady Mary down.

LADY SYBIL
I know. I want to be with her when Captain Crawley arrives. They can manage without me here for a while.

BRANSON
Is she still in love with him?

LADY SYBIL
I don't want to talk about it.

BRANSON
Why? Because I'm the chauffeur?

LADY SYBIL
No, because she's my sister.

BRANSON
You're good at hiding your feelings, aren't you? All of you. Much better than we are.

LADY SYBIL
Perhaps. But we do have feelings and don't make the mistake of thinking we don't.

[Sybil steps into the car angry and closes the door.]

--
[12:35, INT. LEEDS GENERAL INFIRMARY - DAY]
[Mr Mason sits by his son's bedside.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
And has Lord Flincher's order been acted on?
DOCTOR
It has. There's an ambulance waiting. Although, no one quite knows how you managed it.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
What exactly is the matter with him?

DOCTOR
His body's sustained too much damage. He cannot recover.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
But he looks so normal.

DOCTOR
Appearances can be cruelly deceptive. The force of the blast has fatally injured his lungs.

LADY EDITH
But if he's lived this long...

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Would it make any difference if he stayed here? Or are you just making him as comfortable as can be?

DOCTOR
That's it. There's nothing more we can do for him.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
So, you agree with our plan.

DOCTOR
I don't know about you, but I'd rather die in a familiar place surrounded by familiar faces.

[Mr Mason approaches.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
There you are, Mr Mason.

[Mason salutes her.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
It seems we have everything settled. We'll be away before long.

MR MASON
He'll be forced to do better, if we can just get him back to where he knows. I feel sure of it.

DOCTOR
I shouldn't--

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Shouldn't worry too much. We'll know much more when he's rested.

MR MASON
I'm very grateful, milady. To both of you.

LADY EDITH
Let's get him ready.

[Edith and Mr Mason walk over to William. The doctor looks at Violet.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
See, sometimes we must let the blow fall by degrees. Give him time to find the strength to face it.

[BREAK 1]

--
[14:05, INT. DOWNTON COTTAGE HOSPITAL, WARD - DAY]

DR CLARKSON
Right. They're here.

LADY SYBIL
May I stay to settle him in?

DR CLARKSON
Very well.

LADY MARY
I want to help, too.

DR CLARKSON
Lady Mary, I appreciate your good intentions, but I'm concerned that Captain Crawley's condition may be very distressing for you. Might I suggest that you hang back until the nurses have tidied him up a little?

LADY MARY
I'm not much good at hanging back, I'm afraid. I won't get in your way, I promise. But I will stay. You have volunteers, don't you? Well, that's what I am. A volunteer.

DR CLARKSON
All right. Everyone to their posts!

LADY SYBIL (to Mary)
You stand there.

DR CLARKSON
Yes, this gentleman's second in.

NURSE
Yes, Doctor.

[Mary stares at Matthew as they bring him in.]

DR CLARKSON
Number two, Nurse Crawley, here. Yes. Yes, just here. Gently, gently, gently.

LADY SYBIL
Yes, sir. Take him under his feet.

[Mary, Sybil, and a stretcher bearer lift Matthew onto the hospital bed.]

LADY SYBIL
Cousin Matthew, can you hear me?

STRETCHER BEARER
He's breathing, but he's not been conscious since we've had him. We filled him full of morphine .

LADY SYBIL (nods)
Thank you.

[Mary looks at the card attached to Matthew's shirt.]

LADY SYBIL
What does it say?

LADY MARY
Probable spinal damage.

[They exchange a worried look.]

LADY SYBIL
It could mean anything. We'll know more in the morning.

[Sybil picks up Matthew's uniform and Mary's stuffed dog falls out.]

LADY SYBIL
What's this doing here?

LADY MARY
I gave it to him for luck. He was probably carrying it when he fell.

LADY SYBIL
If only it had worked.

LADY MARY
He's alive, isn't he?

LADY SYBIL
I should wash him. This bit can be grim. Sometimes we have to cut off the clothes they've travelled in, and there's bound to be a lot of blood.

LADY MARY (nods)
How hot should the water be?

LADY SYBIL
Warm more than hot. And bring some towels.

--
[16:20, INT. DOWNTON - DAY]
[Daisy peers through a window at the stretcher bearers carrying William into a bedroom.]

--
[16:35, INT. SERVANTS' STAIRCASE - DAY]

THOMAS
You should never have told her Bates was here.

O'BRIEN
Don't I know it. And she was even worse after she'd seen him than before, ranting on about a scandal that would bring the roof down on the house of Grantham. Silly [?].

THOMAS
What scandal?

O'BRIEN
I thought she'd just come up and take a bite out of Bates. That's what it sounded like.

THOMAS
Then you should've asked more questions. You know what they say, the devil is in the detail.

O'BRIEN
I'm not standing by while she brings misery and ruin on my lady.

THOMAS
You started it.

O'BRIEN
Oh, yes, you're very important, aren't you? Very know-it-all with all of us at your beck and call.

THOMAS
I'm sorry if you're angry, but don't take it out on me. You did it.

--
[17:14, INT. LADY MARY'S BEDROOM - EVENING]

LADY MARY
Whom is she going to sell it to?

ANNA
She didn't say. Just that there was nothing we could do to stop her. Mr Bates has given her every last penny to keep her quiet, but she's tricked him, and now he's got nothing left to bargain with.

LADY MARY
Well, we both know what I must do.

ANNA
But how can you ask Sir Richard for help without telling him the truth?

LADY MARY
I'd rather he heard it from my lips that read it over his breakfast.

ANNA
Suppose he won't do anything? Suppose he throws you over?

LADY MARY
That's a risk I'll have to take. I'll go up to London tomorrow afternoon. It's a request that demands to be made in person.

ANNA
What about Mr Matthew?

LADY MARY
Miss Swire will be here to keep him company. I think I can take some time off to save my own neck.

--
[18:10, INT. GUEST BEDROOM - EVENING]
[Edith tends to William.]

LADY EDITH
Why don't you go home now, Mr Mason? We'll see you tomorrow.

MR MASON
Are you sure you don't mind sitting up with him?

LADY EDITH
He won't be alone. Not for a moment. I promise.

MR MASON
He looks so perfect, lying there.

[Mr Mason leaves.]

MRS PATMORE
But he does look perfect. Are you sure they've got it right?

LADY EDITH
I'm afraid so. If only I weren't.

--
[19:04, INT. DOWNTON COTTAGE HOSPITAL, WARD - MORNING]
[Robert peeks in on Dr Clarkson's examination of Matthew's spine. Mary stands inside the screens, watching.]

DR CLARKSON
Do you feel that?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY (nods)
Mm-hmm.

DR CLARKSON
What about that?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
No.

[Robert opens the screen and Mary looks up and sees Lavinia across the room.]

DR CLARKSON
And that? Mm?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
No, nothing.

DR CLARKSON
Nothing at all?

[Mary and Robert go to Lavinia and Mary smiles comfortingly at her as she takes her hands and kisses her cheek.]

LAVINIA
Do they know any more yet?

LADY MARY
They're examining him now.

LAVINIA
So he's conscious?

LADY MARY
Just about.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Have they found out what happened?

LADY MARY
A shell landed near them. The explosion threw Matthew against something.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Go on.

LADY MARY
Dr Clarkson thinks...there may be trouble with his legs.

[Dr Clarkson joins them.]

DR CLARKSON
Not good news, I'm afraid. I'd say the spinal cord has been transected. That it is permanently damaged.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You mean he won't walk again?

DR CLARKSON
If I'm right, then no, he won't.

[Lavinia starts crying and Robert puts a comforting arm around her shoulders.]

DR CLARKSON
It's a shock, of course, and you must be allowed to grieve, but I would only say that he will, in all likelihood, regain his health. This is not the end of his life.

LADY MARY
Just the start of a different life.

DR CLARKSON
Exactly. Lord Grantham, I wonder if I might have a word.

[Robert steps into the corridor with Dr Clarkson and Mary steps forward to comfort Lavinia.]

LAVINIA
Have you got a handkerchief? I never seem to have one in a moment of crisis.

[Mary hands her one.]

LAVINIA
Thank you.

[In the corridor.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You mean there can be no children?

DR CLARKSON
No anything, I'm afraid.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
But isn't there a chance that might change?

DR CLARKSON
The sexual reflex is controlled at a lower level of the spine to the motor function of the legs. Once the latter is cut off, so is the former.

[Meanwhile, Lavinia is recovering.]

LAVINIA
Right.

[Lavinia walks bravely toward the screens around Matthew and Robert returns as Mary makes a step toward them.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Give them a moment together.

[Mary nods.]

LADY MARY
What was Clarkson saying?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Nothing to worry you about.

[Lavinia steps into the screens. Matthew smiles.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
My darling.

[She sits in a chair next to him.]

--
[21:36, EXT. THE VILLAGE - DAY]
[Mrs Hughes picks up a basket and gets onto a bus. She arrives at a house and knocks on the door.]

--
[22:02, INT. ETHEL'S HOUSE - DAY]
[Ethel takes food out of the basket Mrs Hughes bought, a baby in her other arm.]

MRS HUGHES
If he could only see the child.

ETHEL
He won't. I've written again and again. I've offered to bring him to any place he wants.

MRS HUGHES
I wasn't going to tell you this, but he's coming on a visit this week to see his old pals.

ETHEL
Help me, Mrs Hughes. Let me come to Downton and show him the baby!

MRS HUGHES
Oh, certainly not! I won't have that.

ETHEL
Well, then ask him to meet me! I know he'd listen to you. I'll give you a letter. One more can't hurt. Make him read it in front of you.

MRS HUGHES
I--I'll do no such thing.

ETHEL
But please!

MRS HUGHES
He'd say it was none of my business, and he'd be right. Besides, don't think I approve of what you've done, because I don't.

ETHEL
Haven't you ever made a mistake?

MRS HUGHES
Not on this scale. No, I have not. Sorry to disappoint you.

ETHEL
So, you won't do anything?

MRS HUGHES
I'm feeding you out of the house, quite wrongly, I might add. I have a good mind to stop that.

ETHEL
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

--
[23:05, INT. DOWNTON - DAY]
[Mrs Patmore ushers Daisy down the corridor to William's guest bedroom.]

MRS PATMORE
Now, go in.

DAISY
I don't know what to say.

MRS PATMORE
It doesn't matter. He's dying. Just say nice, warm, comforting things. Make him feel loved. You don't have to be Shakespeare.

[Mrs Patmore pushes Daisy into the room.]

WILLIAM
There she is. Come over here where I can see you.

[William holds out his hand and Daisy takes it.]

WILLIAM
By 'eck, it were worth it if I get to hold your hand.

DAISY
Don't be daft.

WILLIAM
I've never slept in a room as big as this. Where are we?

LADY EDITH
At the end of the south gallery. Now take this.

[Edith hands William a tonic.]

WILLIAM
Any news of Captain Crawley?

LADY EDITH
He's doing much better. Thanks to you.

[William drinks the tonic.]

WILLIAM
Dad'll be here in a bit. Can you stay for a minute?

DAISY
I ought to go down. It's not fair on Mrs Patmore.

LADY EDITH
She won't mind.

WILLIAM
Because I did want to ask you something. Daisy, would you ever marry me now and not wait for the end of the war like we said?

LADY EDITH
You mustn't worry about all that for the moment now, William. You're here for rest, not excitement.

DAISY
That's right. There's no need to worry about it now. First let's get you better.

WILLIAM
But would you think about it?

DAISY
I must go. They'll be sending out a search party soon. Just rest.

[William nods and Daisy leaves.]

--
[24:39, INT. MRS HUGHES'S SITTING ROOM - DAY]
[Mrs Hughes looks over an applicant's paperwork.]

MRS HUGHES
It would be very unusual.

JANE MOORSUM
I know that. Of course it would. But I believe I could make it work.

MRS HUGHES
And if your child were ill?

JANE MOORSUM
My mother knows what she's doing. She's brought up five of her own.

MRS HUGHES
Even so--

JANE MOORSUM
And they're only in the village.

MRS HUGHES
I'll discuss it with Mr Carson. There's nothing wrong with your references. But of course, they are from before you were married.

JANE MOORSUM
I'm a good worker. And I must earn.

--
[25:09, INT. DOWNTON COTTAGE HOSPITAL, WARD - DAY]
[Matthew lies in bed, his eyes closed. He sees Mary calling to him in his mind, blue sky behind her at Downton Abbey.]

LADY MARY
Matthew. Matthew.

[Matthew opens his eyes and sees Mary sitting at his bedside.]

LADY MARY
Are you feeling a bit less groggy?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Where's Lavinia?

LADY MARY
She's gone back to unpack.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
How's William? I know he tried to save me.

LADY MARY
He isn't too good, I'm afraid.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Any sign of Mother?

LADY MARY
Not yet. But I'm sure she's making her way back by now.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I've still got this funny thing with my legs, I can't seem to move them. Or feel them, now that I think about it. Did Clarkson mention what that might be?

LADY MARY
Why don't we wait for Lavinia? And then we can all talk about it.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Tell me.

LADY MARY
You've not even been here for twenty-four hours. Nothing will have settled down yet.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Tell me.

LADY MARY
He says you may have damaged your spine.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
How long will it take to repair?

LADY MARY
You can't expect them to put timings on that sort of thing.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
But he did say it would get better?

LADY MARY
He says the first task is to rebuild your health, and that's what we have to concentrate on.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I see.

LADY MARY
And he says there was no reason why you should not have a perfectly full and normal life.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Just not a very mobile one.

LADY MARY
Would you like some tea? I would.

[Mary gets up from her chair.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Thank you for telling me. I know I'm...blubbing, but I mean it. I'd much rather know. Thank you.

LADY MARY
Blub all you like. And then, when Lavinia's here, you can make plans.

[Mary starts crying as she leaves.]

[BREAK 2]

[27:42, INT. GREAT HALL - DAY]
[Mrs Hughes takes a breath and then approaches Major Bryant who is sitting down to cards.]

MRS HUGHES
Major, might I have a word?

[The Major makes a "yeesh! what could that be?" expression to his friends and follows her to the front hall.]

MAJOR BRYANT
What is it?

MRS HUGHES
I have something for you.

[Byrant looks at the handwriting of his name on the letter she holds out, but doesn't take it.]

MAJOR BRYANT
Thank you.

MRS HUGHES
I wish you would read it.

MAJOR BRYANT
Do you know who wrote it?

MRS HUGHES
Yes, I do. And I know how anxious she is for an answer.

MAJOR BRYANT
All due respect, I don't beliebe it's any of your concern.

MRS HUGHES
If you'd only s--

[She waits for a nurse to pass out of earshot.]

MRS HUGHES
If you'd only see the child. He's a lovely wee chap.

MAJOR BRYANT
Mrs Hughes, the last thing I'd wish to be is rude, but in this case, I really must be left to my own devices. Now, I'll say goodbye. It's time I was making tracks.

MRS HUGHES
Goodbye then, Major.

--
[28:49, INT. CARLISLE'S NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY]

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
Who'd've thought it? The cold and careful Lady Mary Crawley. Well, we know better now. I'm surprised you haven't given me some extenuating circumstances.

LADY MARY
I have none. I was foolish, and I was paid out for my folly.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
And when I've saved you - if I can - do you still expect me to marry you, knowing this?

LADY MARY
It's not for me to say.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
Of course, we both know that if we marry, people - your people - will think you've conferred a great blessing on me. My house will welcome the finest in the land, my children will carry noble blood in their veins. But that won't be the whole story, will it? Not anymore.

[Mary stands up.]

LADY MARY
Sir Richard, if you think it pains me to ask this favour, you'd be right. But I have no choice if I am not to be an object of ridicule and pity. If you wish to break off our understanding, I'll accept your decision. After all, it's never been announced. We may dissolve it with the minimum of discomfort.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
Forgive me, I don't mean to offend you. I'm simply paying you the compliment of being honest. No, in many ways, if I can manage to bring it off, this will mean we come to the marriage on slightly more equal terms. I think that pleases me.

LADY MARY
So you'll do it?

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
I'll try to do it, yes.

LADY MARY
You must act fast.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
I'll send a card for her as soon as you've left.

LADY MARY
Please let me know what it costs. I'll find a way to reimburse you.

[Richard takes her hand.]

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
Nevermind that. As my future wife, you're entitled to be in my debt.

--
[30:42, INT. LIBRARY - DAY]

MR CARSON
We've a bit of a conundrum, my lord. As you may know, we're short of a housemaid. We've had an application from a local woman Jane Moorsum, but she's married and she has a child, a son.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Well, surely her husband should be--

MR CARSON
She's a widow, my lord. The late Mr Moorsum died on the Somme. There's no other earner, so she has to look for work. I said I would ask you.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Well, if Mrs Hughes agrees, I think we must do what we can for the widows of our defenders.

MR CARSON
Very good, Your Lordship.

[Cora enters as Carson's leaving.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
What was that?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
We're taking on a new maid.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
He should've talked to me, not you.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Well, they thought you were too busy to be bothered with it.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I am busy. And that reminds me, I can come with you to the Townsends. You'll have to make some excuse.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
But we gave them the date.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
You'll think of something.

--
[31:40, INT. KITCHENS - DAY]
[Daisy and Mrs Patmore whisper together in a corner.]

DAISY
You always said I wouldn't have to marry him when it came to it.

MRS PATMORE
Daisy, he's dying. What difference does it make?

DAISY
All the more reason. I can't lie to him at the end. Don't make me be false to a dying man.

MRS PATMORE
Well, what matters now is that poor lad knows some peace and some happiness before he goes.

DAISY
I can't.

--
[32:00, INT. DOWNTON COTTAGE HOSPITAL, WARD - DAY]

LAVINIA
I don't care if you can't walk. You must think me very feeble if you believe that would make a difference.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I know it wouldn't. And I love you so much for saying it. But there's something else, which may not have occurred to you. This is very difficult. We can never be properly married.

LAVINIA
What? Of course we can be married.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Not properly.

LAVINIA
Oh. I see.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
That's why I have to let you go.

LAVINIA
But...that side of things, it's not important to me, I promise.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
My darling, it's—it's not important now, but—but it will be. I think it should be. And I couldn't possibly be responsible for stealing away the life you ought to have.

LAVINIA
I won't leave you. I know you think I'm weak, and I don't know what I'm taking on.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
How could you? For God's sake.

LAVINIA
I'm not saying it'll be easy for either of us. But just because life isn't easy doesn't mean it isn't right.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I won't fight with you. But I won't steal away your life. Go home. Think of me as dead. Remember me as I was.

--
[33:48, INT. DOWNTON GARAGE - DAY]
[Branson's reading the newspaper when Sybil walks up.]

LADY SYBIL
Mary's telephoned. She'll be on the late train. It gets in at eleven.

BRANSON
All right. How's William?

LADY SYBIL
It's so sad. Edith's taking care of him, but there's nothing to be done. We're waiting, really.

[Edith sees Branson staring off into space with a serious expression.]

LADY SYBIL
What is it?

BRANSON
They shot the tsar, and all of his family.

LADY SYBIL
How terrible.

BRANSON
I'm sorry. I'll not deny it. I never thought they'd do it. But sometimes a future needs terrible sacrifices. You thought that once.

LADY SYBIL
If you mean my politics, you know we've agreed to put that to one side until the war is won.

BRANSON
Your lot did. But Sylvia Pankhurst was all for fighting on.

LADY SYBIL
Don't badger me, please!

[Sybil begins to march off, but Branson grabs her waist and she stops in surprise. She meets his gaze and he lets go of her waist and puts his hands in his pockets.]

BRANSON
Sometimes a hard sacrifice must be made for a future that's worth having. That's all I'm saying. That's up to you.

[Sybil leans toward him and looks down at his lips. Surprised to see her reserve fading, Branson waits for her to give in, but she stops herself and pulls back. He sighs disappointedly as she walks back to the house.]

--
[35:07, INT. CARLISLE'S NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY]

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
You understand it would have to be exclusive. I couldn't have you peddling different versions of this story to my competitors.

VERA BATES
Of course I understand. But I can't help it if they pick it up once you've published it.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
Indeed you can't. No more can I, but I would control the timing. You'd have to sign a binding contract to that effect today.

VERA BATES
I expected that.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
And I warn you, I am unforgiving when anyone breaks a contract with me. One word out of place and you'd find yourself in court.

VERA BATES
I expected that, too. But I'm curious, how did you hear about me?

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
I know everything that goes on in this city.

VERA BATES
And what's the hurry?

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
I'm a newspaper man. When I hear of something good, I have to make sure of it straight away. I'm sorry if I rushed you.

VERA BATES
Tha--that's all right.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
You must dislike the Crawleys very much to want to subject them to trial by scandal.

VERA BATES
My husband works for them. We're not on good terms.

[BREAK 3]

--
[36:06, INT. KITCHEN - EVENING]
[Daisy absentmindedly sifts flour.]

MRS PATMORE
How is he?

MRS HUGHES (sigh)
His father's with him now and he seems to understand the situation.

MRS PATMORE
Poor man.

MRS HUGHES
Daisy, William's asking to see you.

DAISY
I can't go. Don't make me go.

MRS PATMORE
Do you care so little for him?

DAISY
It's not that. I'm very fond of William, and I'm very sad, but I've led him on and led him on and made him think things that aren't true.

MRS PATMORE
He wanted them to be true. He was happy to think they were true.

DAISY
But that doesn't make it all right.

MRS HUGHES
Shall I tell him you won't come?

[Both Mrs Hughes and Mrs Patmore give Daisy a stern look. She takes off her apron and leaves.]

--
[37:03, INT. GUEST BEDROOM - EVENING]
[Daisy enters. William's voice is hoarse.]

WILLIAM
Will you leave us a moment?

[Mr Mason and Edith leave the room.]

DAISY
There's no need to make 'em leave.

WILLIAM
There is a need. Come here.

[Daisy sits in the chair next to his bed.]

WILLIAM
I know I'm dying.

DAISY
You don't know--

WILLIAM
I'm dying, Daisy. I'm not going to make it. I don't have long. That's why you've got to marry me.

DAISY
What?

WILLIAM
No, listen. You'll be my widow. A war widow with a pension and rights. You'll be looked after. It won't be much, but I'll know you've got something to fall back on. Let me do that for you, please.

DAISY
I can't. It would be dishonest. Almost like cheating.

WILLIAM
But it's not cheating. We love each other, don't we? We'd've married if I'd got through it, spent our whole lives together. Where's the dishonesty in that?

[Mr Mason and Edith wait in the corridor. Edith enters the room when Daisy comes out.]

MR MASON
He's asked you, hasn't he? I knew he would. You'll do it, won't you?

DAISY
I don't think he should be bothering about it now.

MR MASON
What else should he be bothered with? You're the most important thing on earth to him, Daisy. You wouldn't disappoint him, would you?

DAISY
Suppose the vicar won't do it? He may want to wait till William's well enough to go to church.

MR MASON
But that time's not coming, is it?

--
[39:31, INT. LAVINIA'S GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT]

LADY MARY
Lavinia?

[Mary finds Lavinia crying in bed.]

LAVINIA
You're back.

[Mary nods.]

LAVINIA
How did you get on?

LADY MARY
All right, I think. How about you?

LAVINIA
Matthew's told me to go home. He says he won't see me again. He feels he has to set me free, as he put it. I've tried to tell him I don't care, but he won't listen.

LADY MARY
Then you must keep telling him.

LAVINIA
Yes, but you see, it isn't just not walking. Today he told me we could never be lovers, because all that's gone as well. I didn't realise. It's probably obvious to anyone with a brain, but I didn't realise.

LADY MARY
No. No, nor did I.

[Mary sits on the bed as she tries to process this news.]

LAVINIA
And he feels it would be a crime to tie me down, to tie down any woman to the life of a childless nun. He thinks I'd hate him in the end. I'm sorry if I've shocked you, but there's no one else I could talk to about it, and when you came in, I--

LADY MARY
I'm not shocked. I'm just stunned. And desperately sad.

LAVINIA
I'll die if I can't be with him.

--
[41:14, INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING]
[Robert reads the newspaper.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Good God Almighty. "The engagement is announced between Lady Mary Josephine Crawley, eldest daughter of the Earl and Countess of Grantham, and Sir Richard Carlisle, son of Mr and the late Mrs Mark Carlisle of Morningside Edinburgh." Is this why you went to see him? Why didn't you say it'd be in today's paper?

LADY MARY
I didn't know.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Well, surely he asked your permission?

LADY MARY
I don't think asking permission is his strongest suit.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
That's very high handed. You can't let him get away with it.

LADY EDITH
Well, it's done now.

[Mr Carson steps forward.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
What is it?

MR CARSON
William's wedding, my lord. If it can be arranged for this afternoon, the indoor staff would like to attend.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
We don't yet know if Mr Travis will agree to do it.

MR CARSON
I'm afraid he has very little time to make up his mind.

--
[42:01, INT. THE DOWER HOUSE - MORNING]

REVEREND TRAVIS
This boy is an extremist. How can we know that these are his true wishes? Maybe the kitchen maid somehow hopes to catch at an advantage.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Well, what advantage would that be?

REVEREND TRAVIS
Some widow's dole given by a grateful nation?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Mr Travis, can I remind you William Mason has served our family well. At the last, he saved the life, if not the health, of my son's heir. Now he wishes before he dies to marry his sweetheart.

REVEREND TRAVIS
Yes, but—

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
You cannot imagine that we would allow you to prevent this happening in case his widow "claimed her dole".

REVEREND TRAVIS
No, but--

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I have had an interest in this boy. I tried and failed to save him from conscription, but I will certainly attend his wedding. Is that an argument in its favour?

REVEREND TRAVIS
Of course, but—

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Finally, I would point out your living is in Lord Grantham's gift. Your house is on Lord Grantham's land, and the very flowers in your church are from Lord Grantham's garden. I hope it is not vulgar in me to suggest that you find some way to overcome your scruples.

--
[43:19, INT. ETHEL'S HOUSE - DAY]

MRS HUGHES
You can't have expected much more. Not when those letters all went unanswered.

ETHEL
I don't know what I expected, but you can't help hoping.

MRS HUGHES
Have you found any work?

ETHEL
Bit of scrubbing. There aren't many places I can take the baby.

MRS HUGHES
What do you tell them?

ETHEL
That my husband died at the front.

MRS HUGHES
It's funny, we have a new maid, Jane, who really is a war widow with a child and we respect her for it. But then, we believe her story.

--
[44:08, INT. CARLISLE'S NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY]
[A secretary tries to stop Vera Bates from storming into Carlisle's office.]

SECRETARY
Mrs Bates, I really must insist that--

VERA BATES
You tricked me! Well, aren't you going to deny it?

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
Certainly not. I tricked you to protect my fiancé's good name.

VERA BATES
That's one word for her. I can think of a few others.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
You better not speak them aloud if you know what's good for you.

VERA BATES
I don't want your money, I don't want that contract.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
It's too late for that. And I warn you, if I so much as read her name in anything but the court circular, I shall hunt you, I will ruin you, and have you locked up. Is that clear?

[Stunned, Vera thinks for a moment.]

VERA BATES
It doesn't end here, you know. Not for John Bates. Lady Mary might've got away, what do I care? But he won't. You tell him.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
That's entirely your own affair.

[Vera marches out.]

--
[44:55, INT. LIBRARY - DAY]
[Robert flips through the library catalogue. Jane stumbles in noisily with cleaning supplies.]

JANE
Where do we start?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You tell me.

[Jane's jaw drops.]

JANE
Oh! Y--your Lordship, I-- I do apologise. I thought Mrs Hughes said we were to clean in here.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You must be the new maid.

[The telephone rings.]

JANE
I am. Jane. And it's very kind of you and Her Ladyship to take me on.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Not a bit. We all owe your late husband a great debt.

[Jane nods, upset.]

JANE
Thank you.

[Mrs Hughes enters.]

MRS HUGHES
Milord, there's a telephone call for-- Jane? Whatever are you doing? You're wanted in the drawing room, not the library, to clean it while the men are out of it.

[Robert watches Jane hurry out.]

MRS HUGHES
She's very willing, but she's not quite there yet. I am sorry.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Oh, don't be. What about that call?

MRS HUGHES
For Lady Mary. They're waiting now.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You might just catch her if you hurry. She's on her way to the hospital.

--
[45:50, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - DAY]
[Daisy stares into space, dressed for her wedding. Mr Carson enters with a bouquet of flowers.]

MR CARSON
His Lordship asked Mr Vassit to bring these in for you.

ANNA
Aw, how lovely. Here. Daisy, sit down.

DAISY
I shouldn't be doing this. It's just a lie, you know it is.

MRS PATMORE
You're doing it out of the goodness of your heart.

DAISY
The falseness of my heart, more like.

[O'Brien talks to Thomas on the stairs.]

O'BRIEN
She's not quite the blooming bride.

THOMAS
I don't think it's the same when you're marrying a corpse.

O'BRIEN
Are you going?

THOMAS
Why not? I won't mind shaking William's hand before he goes.

[They let Mrs Hughes descend the stairs between them.]

O'BRIEN
Is that sentiment or superstition in case he haunts you?

[Back in the hall.]

MRS HUGHES
You look lovely, dear. Just to say, the vicar is ready for us.

MR CARSON
Let's go up, then.

[Mr Carson offers Daisy his arm. Anna hands her the bouquet. Daisy slowly stands up, takes the bouquet and Carson's arm and allows herself to be led to her wedding. The bed is woven with vines of flowers. Daisy and William hold hands. Edith and Violet attend along with Mr Mason, Anna, Bates, Mrs Hughes, Carson, Mrs Patmore, Thomas, O'Brien, and another maid.]

REVEREND TRAVIS
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God, and in the face of this congregation to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony, which is an honourable estate, instituted of God in the time of man's innocency, signifying unto us the mystical union of Christ and--

[Violet dabs her eyes with a handkerchief.]

REVEREND TRAVIS
If any man can show any just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter forever hold his peace.

[William gives Daisy a small smile and she gives one back.]

REVEREND TRAVIS
Hand me the ring.

[Mr Mason pulls the ring out of his vest pocket. Anna and Mr Carson are also on the verge of tears. William puts the ring on Daisy's finger. Edith sees Violet crying and puts her hand on her shoulder.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM (sniffle)
Cold.

REVEREND TRAVIS
You may now kiss the bride.

[Daisy leans over the bed and kisses William.]

[BREAK 4]

[48:28, INT. DOWNTON COTTAGE HOSPITAL, WARD - DAY]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
She's better off in London.

LADY MARY
If you say so.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Do you know why I sent her away?

LADY MARY
I think so.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Then you'll know I couldn't marry her. Not now. I couldn't marry any woman.

LADY MARY
And if they should just want to be with you? On any terms?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
No one sane would want to be with me as I am now. Including me. Oh, God. I think I'm going to be sick.

[Mary picks up the sick bowl and helps Matthew sit up.]

LADY MARY
It's all right.

[Mary rubs his back as Matthew vomits into the bowl.]

LADY MARY
It's perfectly all right.

[Matthew lies back down and starts to chuckle as Mary wipes his mouth clean.]

LADY MARY
What is it?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I was just thinking it seems such a short time ago since I turned you down, and now look at me. Impotent, cripple, stinking of sick. What a reversal. You have to admit, it's quite funny.

[Isobel enters and watches Mary sitting with Matthew.]

LADY MARY
All I'll admit is that you're here and you've survived the war. That's enough for now.

[Mary gets up and takes the sick bowl with her. She meets Isobel.]

LADY MARY
You're back. He'll be so pleased.

[Isobel looks at the sick bowl.]

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
You've become quite a nurse since I last saw you.

LADY MARY
No, no. It's nothing. Sybil's the nurse in this family.

[Mary leaves and Isobel walks to Matthew's bedside.]

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
It's the very opposite of nothing.

[Matthew sees Isobel and starts breathing hard with relief and tears.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Mother.

--
[50:23, INT. DOWNTON - DAY]
[Mary walks up the steps, upset.]

LADY MARY
Bates. What's happened? How's William?

MR BATES
He's nearly there, my lady.

LADY MARY
I'm so sorry. Actually, Bates, I'm glad I've caught you. Sir Richard Carlisle telephoned me earlier. He says he's paid Mrs Bates for her story. She cannot speak of it now without risking prison.

MR BATES
She won't do that.

LADY MARY
So, I hope we can all forget it.

MR BATES
It's forgotten already, milady.

LADY MARY
Thank you.

[Mr Bates turns to go.]

LADY MARY
I'm afraid she was very angry when she knew she had been silenced.

MR BATES
I can imagine. He says she made threats against you. "If I go down, I'll take him with me," that sort of thing.

LADY MARY
I'm sure she didn't mean it.

MR BATES
Are you, milady?

LADY MARY
Well, you'd know better than I.

[They go their separate ways. Anna meets Bates in the hall with a tray.]

ANNA
Lady Mary's back.

MR BATES
I've just seen her. She says it's worked. Sir Richard has put a gag on Vera.

ANNA
Thank God. So everything in our garden is rosy again?

MR BATES
I hope so. I certainly hope so.

[They smile at each other and Anna continues down the hall with the tray.]

--
[51:49, INT. GUEST BEDROOM - DAY]
[Mrs Patmore enters. Daisy is sitting on the bed and Mr Mason on the chair next to it. Mrs Patmore takes Daisy's hands.]

MRS PATMORE
You must be so tired, my love. Why not let me take over for a while and go and lie down.

DAISY MASON
No thank you, Mrs Patmore. I'll stay with him. I won't leave him now, not while he needs me.

MR MASON
He doesn't need you no more, Daisy.

[William has just stopped breathing.]

MR MASON
He doesn't need none of us no more.

[Mr Mason takes Daisy's hand.]
