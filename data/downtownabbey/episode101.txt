[OPENING CREDITS]
[A hand taps out Morse code. A train whistle blows. Mr Bates sits in one of the cars. A woman takes down the telegram message.]

WOMAN
Oh, my God.

MAN
That's impossible. I'll take it up there now.

WOMAN
Don't be stupid. None of them will be up for hours and what difference will it make?

[She hands him the telegram.]

WOMAN
Jimmy'll do it when he comes in.

[00:01:41, DOWNTON ABBEY, SERVANTS' CORRIDOR - MORNING]
[Daisy knocks on the housemaids' bedroom door.]

DAISY
Six o'clock!

[HOUSEMAIDS' BEDROOM - MORNING]
[Gwen sits up in bed.]

GWEN
Thank you, Daisy. Anna.

[Anna stirs in her bed.]

ANNA
For once in my life I'd like to sleep until I woke up natural.

--
[00:02:00, KITCHENS - MORNING]

MRS PATMORE
Is your fire still in?

DAISY
Yes, Mrs Patmore.

MRS PATMORE
Oh, my, my, will wonders never cease? Have you laid the servants' hall breakfast?

DAISY
Yes, Mrs Patmore.

MRS PATMORE
And finished blacking that stove?

DAISY
Yes, Mrs Patmore.

MRS PATMORE
What about the bedroom fires?

DAISY
All lit, Mrs Patmore.

MRS PATMORE
Right, well, take your things and get started on the fires on the ground floor.

[Daisy carries a bucket of firewood through the servants' hall and up through the main rooms into the library.]

HOUSEMAID 1 (to Daisy)
Now hurry up.

[Daisy hurries through the library. A footman, Thomas, enters with a silver tray with two drinks. He collects two more in another room.]

THOMAS
Any sign of William?

HOUSEMAID 2
No.

[Thomas enters the breakfast room where William is laying the tablecloth.]

THOMAS
Where have you been?

WILLIAM
I'm not late, am I?

THOMAS
You're late when I say you're late.

--
[00:03:30, DRAWING ROOM - MORNING]
[Anna and Gwen open the windows and fluff the pillows.]

ANNA
Daisy? Whatever are you doing there crouching in the dark?

DAISY
You weren't here and I didn't want to touch the curtains with my dirty hands.

GWEN
And quite right, too.

ANNA
Why didn't you put the lights on?

DAISY
I daren't.

GWEN
Well, it's electricity, not the devil's handiwork. You'll have to get used to it sooner or later.

ANNA
Skelton Park have even got it in the kitchens.

DAISY
What for?

--
[00:03:57, SERVANTS' CORRIDOR - MORNING]
[Mrs Hughes, the housekeeper, walks with the keys. William knocks on the butler's door while he's polishing the silver.]

WILLIAM
Breakfast is ready, Mr Carson.

MR CARSON
Ah, William, any papers yet?

WILLIAM
They're late.

MR CARSON
They certainly are. Get the board out so you can do them as soon as they're here.

[William sets up a board used for ironing the newspaper.]

--
[00:04:17, DRAWING ROOM - MORNING]

MRS HUGHES
Is the library tidy?

ANNA
Yes, Mrs Hughes.

MRS HUGHES
Good. I want the dining room given a proper going over today. You can do it when they've finished their breakfast. Oh, heavens, girl! You're building a fire, not inventing it. How many have you done?

DAISY
This is my last till they come downstairs.

MRS HUGHES
Very well. Now, get back down to the kitchens before anyone sees you.

--
[00:04:45, EXT. DOWNTON - MORNING]
[The paperboy cycles up to Downton. Lady Mary gets out of bed and sees him ride past her window. She rings the bell.]

--
[00:05:13, SERVANTS' HALL - MORNING]
[The bell for the Queen Caroline room rings as the servants are eating breakfast.]

THOMAS
And they're off.

MRS HUGHES
No rest for the wicked.

[Mrs Patmore looks at the bells]

MRS PATMORE
Lady Mary. Are the tea trays ready?

[Anna gets up from the table.]

ANNA
All ready, Mrs Patmore, if the water's boiled. Could you give us a hand to take the other two up?

MISS O'BRIEN
I've got Her Ladyship's to carry.

GWEN
I'll help.

[Another bell rings.]

MRS HUGHES
Back door.

MR CARSON
The papers at last. William.

--
[00:05:29, EXT. BACK DOOR - MORNING]
[The paperboy reads the newspaper as William steps out.]

WILLIAM
You're late.

PAPERBOY
Yeah. I--I know, but--

WILLIAM
But what?

PAPERBOY
You'll see.

--
[00:05:38, MR CARSON'S OFFICE - MORNING]
[William irons the newspaper.]

MR CARSON
Do The Times first. He only reads that at breakfast, and The Sketch for Her Ladyship. You can manage the others later if need be.

[William nods as Carson leaves. He starts to fold up the paper, but stops when he sees something and reads it.]

--
[00:05:55, SERVANTS' HALL - MORNING]

DAISY
Why are the papers ironed?

MRS PATMORE
What's it to you?

MISS O'BRIEN
To dry the ink, silly. We won't want His Lordship's hands as black as yours.

[More bells ring. Daisy finishes clearing the table and Miss O'Brien gets up.]

WILLIAM
Mr Carson, I think you ought to see this.

[William hands him the newspaper.]

--
[00:06:12, KITCHENS - MORNING]

MRS HUGHES
I can't make myself believe it.

MRS PATMORE
Me neither.

THOMAS
His Lordship's dressed.

[Mrs Patmore looks over at William who is talking to Daisy.]

MRS PATMORE
William! Will you stop talking and take this kedgeree up, and mind the burners are still lit.

WILLIAM
Yes, Mrs Patmore.

[William takes the dish and heads out.]

THOMAS
Is it really true?

WILLIAM
Afraid so.

MRS PATMORE
Nothing in life is sure.

--
[00:06:32, BREAKFAST ROOM - MORNING]
[Robert, Earl of Grantham, descends the stairs with his dog.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Morning, Carson.

MR CARSON
Good morning, my lord.

[Robert dishes up the breakfast buffet for himself.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Is it true what they're saying?

MR CARSON
I believe so, my lord.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I'm afraid we'll know some people on it. I don't suppose there are any lists of survivors yet?

MR CARSON
I understand most of the ladies were taken off in time.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You mean the ladies in first class?

[Carson nods grimly.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
God help the poor devils below decks.

[Robert takes his breakfast to the table and puts the napkin in his lap as he sits down.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
On their way to a better life. What a tragedy.

[Robert opens the newspaper to see a picture of the Titanic. Lady Mary and Lady Edith enter and read over his shoulder.]

LADY EDITH
When Anna told me, I thought she must've dreamt it.

LADY MARY
Do we know anyone on board?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Your mother knows the Asters. At least, she knows him. We dined with Lady Rothfuss last month. There are bound to be others.

LADY EDITH
I thought it was supposed to be unsinkable.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Every mountain is unclimbable until someone climbs it, so every ship is unsinkable until it sinks.

THOMAS
My lady.

[Thomas hands Lady Sybil a tray with the post and she takes the letter before she enters.]

LADY SYBIL
Good morning, Papa.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Morning. What's that?

LADY SYBIL
Just arrived. Telegram.

[Robert opens it while he continues to read the paper. Then he is stunned by the telegram's contents. His daughters stare at him, waiting. He gets up from the table without a word.]

--
[00:08:14, CORRIDOR - MORNING]
[Robert passes Miss O'Brien as he walks down the hall.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Is Her Ladyship awake?

MISS O'BRIEN
Yes, Milord. I'm just going to take in her breakfast.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Thank you.

[Robert knocks on a door. There's a muffled reply behind the door.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
May I come in?

[Robert enters.]

--
[00:08:23, INT. LADY GRANTHAM'S BEDROOM - DAY]
[Cora is reading the Daily Sketch.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Isn't this terrible? When you think how excited Lucy Rothfuss was at the prospect. It's too awful for any words. Did J.J. Aster get off? Of course, that new wife of his has bound to have been rescued.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I've had a telegram from George Murray. One of his partners is in New York.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Yes?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
It seems James and Patrick were on board.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
What? They can't have been. They weren't going over till may.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Then they changed their plans. They're definitely on the passenger list.

[O'Brien brings the breakfast tray to Cora in bed.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Thank you, O'Brien, that'll be all for the moment. (to Robert) But surely they were picked up?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
It doesn't look like it.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
What?

[Cora puts her breakfast tray aside.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Neither of them? You must tell Mary. She can't hear about it from anyone else.

[Robert nods.]

[BREAK 1]

ACT TWO
[00:09:23, SERVANTS' CORRIDOR - DAY]
[A man walks with a cane and a travel bag.]

--
[00:09:28, LADY MARY'S BEDROOM - DAY]
[O'Brien holds a white cloth as she talks to Anna and Gwen as the house maids make the bed.]

MISS O'BRIEN
"Neither of them were picked up," that's what he said.

ANNA
Mr Crawley and Mr Patrick?

MISS O'BRIEN
That's what he said. Her Ladyship was the colour of this cloth.

GWEN
Well, it's a terrible shame if it's true.

MISS O'BRIEN
It's worse than a shame. It's a complication.

[O'Brien leaves. Gwen and Anna follow O'Brien down the servants' staircase.]

GWEN
Well, what do you mean?

MISS O'BRIEN
What do you think? Mr Crawley was His Lordship's cousin and heir to the title.

GWEN
Well, but I thought Lady Mary was the heir.

MISS O'BRIEN
She's a girl, stupid. Girls can't inherit. But now Mr Crawley's dead, and Mr Patrick was his only son. So, what happens next?

ANNA
It's a dreadful thing.

[The maids find Mr Bates standing in the servants' corridor with his cane and travel bag.]

MR BATES
Hello. I've been waiting at the back door. I knocked, but no one came.

MISS O'BRIEN
So you pushed in?

MR BATES
I'm John Bates, the new valet.

MISS O'BRIEN
The new valet?

MR BATES
That's right.

[O'Brien looks down at Bates's cane.]

MISS O'BRIEN
You're early.

MR BATES
Came on the milk train, thought I'd use the day to get to know the place, start tonight.

ANNA
I'm Anna, the head housemaid.

[Anna shifts the sheets and candle in her arms to shake his hand.]

MR BATES
How do you do?

[Bates reaches to shake O'Brien's hand, but she doesn't take it.]

MISS O'BRIEN
And I'm Miss O'Brien, Her Ladyship's maid. You better come along with us.

[Anna and Bates exchange a small smile before following into the servants' hall.]

--
[00:10:45, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - DAY]

MRS HUGHES
But how can you manage?

MR BATES
Don't worry about that. I can manage.

MRS PATMORE
Because we've all got our own work to do.

MR BATES
I can manage.

MR CARSON
All right, Mrs Hughes, I'll take over, thank you. Good morning, Mr Bates. Welcome. I hope your journey was satisfactory.

MR BATES
It was fine, thank you.

MR CARSON
I am the butler at Downton. My name is Carson.

MR BATES
How do you do, Mr Carson?

MR CARSON
This is Thomas, first footman. He's been looking after His Lordship since Mr Watson left. It'll be a relief to get back to normal, won't it, Thomas?

[Thomas gives a short, insincere smile. Mr Carson turns to Mrs Hughes.]

MR CARSON
I assume that everything is ready for Mr Bates's arrival?

MRS HUGHES
I put him in Mr Watson's old room. Though he left it in quite a state, I can tell you.

MRS PATMORE
But what about all them stairs?

MR BATES
I keep telling you...I can manage.

ANNA
Of course you can.

[Bates and Anna exchange a friendly smile.]

MR CARSON
Thomas, take Mr Bates to his room and show him where he'll be working.

[Thomas and Bates leave.]

MR CARSON
Thank you everyone.

MISS O'BRIEN
Well, I can't see that lasting long.

MR CARSON
Thank you, Miss O'Brien.

[Carson leaves. Carson looks up at the daunting flights of stairs and Thomas smiles before ascending ahead of him.]

--
[00:12:02, INT. SERVANTS' BEDROOM CORRIDOR - DAY]
[Bates is panting as they walk down the corridor. Thomas opens the door to his room and Bates looks at the modest wardrobe, chair, washing basin, cots, nightstand, and dresser.]

MR BATES
Oh, yes. I shall be comfortable here.

--
[00:12:27, INT. LIBRARY - DAY]

LADY MARY
Does this mean I'll have to go into full mourning?

[Robert is shocked and upset.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
My first cousin and his son are almost certainly dead. We will all be in mourning.

LADY MARY
No. I mean, with the other thing. After all, it wasn't official.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
If you're saying you do not wish to mourn Patrick as a fiancé, that is up to you.

LADY MARY
Well, no one knew about it outside the family.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I repeat, it is up to you.

LADY MARY
Well, that's a relief.

[She looks up at her father, realizing how that sounded. Robert turns to sit down at his desk and Mary leaves.]

--
[00:13:11, INT. LORD GRANTHAM'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY]
[Thomas shows Bates around the house.]

THOMAS
There's some cedar-lined cupboards in the attics for things that aren't often worn, travelling clothes and such. Mr Watson used them to rotate the summer and winter stuff; I'll show you later.

MR BATES
What about studs and links? Do I choose them, or does he?

THOMAS
Lay them out unless he asks for something in particular. These for a ball, these for an ordinary dinner, these only in London.

MR BATES
I'll get the hang of it.

THOMAS
Yeah, you'll have to.

[Mr Bates lifts a lid on a case.]

THOMAS
Snuff boxes. He collects them.

MR BATES
Beautiful. Funny our job, isn't it?

THOMAS
What do you mean?

MR BATES
The way we live with all this, pirates horde within our reach. But none of it's ours, is it?

THOMAS
No, none of it's ours.

--
[00:14:04, INT. CORRIDOR - DAY]
[Thomas stops as he passes O'Brien in the corridor.]

THOMAS
I can't believe I've been passed over for Long John Silver.

MISS O'BRIEN
You should've spoken up when you had the chance. Don't make the same mistake next time.

THOMAS
Who says there'll be a next time?

[Mrs Hughes enters the corridor.]

MRS HUGHES
Is this a public holiday no one's told me of?

[Thomas continues on his way.]

--
[00:14:28, EXT. DOWNTON ABBEY, GROUNDS - DAY]
[Robert and Cora go on a walk with the dog.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
She was certainly reluctant to go into mourning.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Well, she'll have to; we all will. O'Brien's sorting out my black now, and I've told Anna to see what the girls have that still fits. Of course, this alters everything. You won't try to deny it. You must challenge the entail now, surely?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Can't we at least wait until we know they're dead before we discuss it?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Don't talk as if I'm not broken-hearted, because I am. Of course, I've never understood why this estate must go to whomever inherits your title.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
My dear, I don't make the law.

[Mr Carson approaches them from the house.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
What is it?

MR CARSON
The Dowager Countess is in the drawing room.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I'll come now.

MR CARSON
She asked for Lady Grantham.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I wonder what I've done wrong this time.

MR CARSON
And the new valet has arrived, My Lord.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Has he? Er...thank you, Carson.

[Carson clears his throat.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
What is it?

MR CARSON
I'm not entirely sure that he'll prove equal to the task, but Your Lordship will be the judge of that.

[Carson returns to the house and Robert turns to Cora.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Better go.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Tell her about James and Patrick; she won't have heard.

--
[00:15:41, INT. DRAWING ROOM - DAY]
[Violet is dressed in black.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Of course I've heard. Why else would I be here?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Robert didn't want you to read about it in a newspaper and be upset.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
He flatters me. I'm tougher than I look.

[Cora sighs.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I'm very sorry about poor Patrick, of course. He was a nice boy.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
We were all so fond of him.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
But I never cared for James. He was too like his mother and a nastier woman never drew breath.

[Cora puts on a smile.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Will you stay for some luncheon?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Thank you.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I'll let Carson know.

[Cora heads for the door.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I've already told him. Shall we sit down?

[They sit.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Do you know the new heir?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Only that there is one.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
He's Robert's third cousin, once removed. I have never, well, to my knowledge, set eyes on him.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Of course, if your late husband hadn't forced me to sign that absurd act of legal theft--

[Violet puts up a hand.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
My dear, I didn't come here to fight. Lord Grantham wanted to protect the estate. It never occurred to him that you wouldn't have a son.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Well, I didn't.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
No...you did not. But when Patrick had married Mary, and you grandson been hailed as master, honour would have been satisfied. Unfortunately, now...

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Now a complete unknown has the right to pocket my money, along with the rest of the swag.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
The problem is, saving your dowry would break up the estate. It would be the ruin of everything Robert's given his life to.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
And he knows this?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Well, if he doesn't, he will.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Then there's no answer.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Yes, there is, and it's a simple one. The entail must be smashed in its entirety, and Mary recognized as heiress of all.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
There's nothing we can do about the title.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
No. She can't have the title. But she can have your money. And the estate. I didn't run Downton for thirty years to see it go lock, stock, and barrel to a stranger from God knows where.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Are we to be friends, then?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
We are allies, my dear, which can be a good deal more effective.

--
[00:18:01, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - DAY]
[Daisy carries a pitcher from the kitchens to the servants' hall where the servants are sitting down to luncheon.]

MR CARSON
Downton is a great house, Mr Bates, and the Crawleys are a great family. We live by certain standards and those standards can at first seem daunting.

MR BATES
Of course.

MR CARSON
If you find yourself tongue-tied in the presence of His Lordship, I can only assure you that his manners and grace will soon help you to perform your duties to the best of your ability.

MR BATES
I know.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Bates!

[All of the servants stand.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
My dear fellow. I do apologise, I should have realised you'd all be at luncheon.

MR CARSON
Not at all, my lord.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Please, sit. Sit, everyone. I just want to say a quick hello to my old comrade in arms. Bates, my dear man, welcome to Downton.

[They shake hands.]

MR BATES
Thank you, sir.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I'm so sorry to have disturbed you all. Please forgive me.

[Robert leaves and the ones who seated themselves rise slightly in their chairs. The servants turn their surprised looks on Mr Bates. He shrugs.]

MR BATES
You never asked.

[BREAK 2]

ACT THREE
[00:19:01, INT. KITCHENS - DAY]

MRS PATMORE
Thomas, take that up.

[Daisy moves to help him.]

MRS PATMORE
Easy, Daisy, he's a grown man! I suppose he can lift a meat pie.

[Daisy smiles brightly at Thomas as he exits with the tray.]

MRS PATMORE
Now, put that apple tart in the lower oven.

[Daisy complies.]

MRS PATMORE
Oh, and take that away. Mr Lynch shouldn't have left it there.

DAISY
What is it?

MRS PATMORE
Salt of sorrel. I asked him for some to clean the brass pots. So, put it somewhere careful; it's poison.

DAISY
Seems like a lot of food when you think they're all in mourning.

MRS PATMORE
Nothing makes you hungrier or more tired than grief.

[Daisy gazes after Thomas with a smitten smile as he takes up the next dish.]

MRS PATMORE
When my sister died, God rest her soul, I ate my way through four platefuls of sandwiches at one sitting and slept 'round the clock.

DAISY
Did it make you feel better?

MRS PATMORE
Not much, but it passed the time. Oh, my lord. What was this chopped egg suppose to be sprinkled on?

DAISY
Was it the chicken?

MRS PATMORE
It was. Take it upstairs now.

DAISY
I can't go in the dining room.

MRS PATMORE
I should think not! Find Thomas or William and tell them what to do. Oh, for heaven's sake, get a move on, girl, before they get back from church!

[Daisy grabs the bowl and rushes out.]

--
[00:20:03, EXT. CHURCHYARD - DAY]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Well, we've given them a memorial in London and a memorial here.

GEORGE MURRAY
I prefer memorials to funerals, they're less dispiriting.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
We could hardly have held a funeral without the bodies.

GEORGE MURRAY
I gather they're putting up a stone to mark those whose bodies were never found. In fact, I hear the Canadians are making quite a thing of the Titanic cemetery. I'm surprised at the number they found. You'd think the sea would've taken more of them.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
So, Murray, what have you to tell me about the lucky Mr Crawley? Nothing too terrible, I hope.

[Murray chuckles.]

GEORGE MURRAY
I've only made a few inquiries, but no, there's, er, not much to alarm you. Matthew Crawley is a solicitor based in Manchester.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Manchester?

GEORGE MURRAY
His special field is company law. His mother is alive and he lives with her, his father obviously is not; he was a doctor.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I know. It does seem odd that my third cousin should be a doctor.

GEORGE MURRAY
There are worse professions.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Indeed.

--
[00:21:09, INT. SERVANTS' CORRIDOR - DAY]
[William stops to wipe his brow and Daisy rushes up to him.]

DAISY
Do me a favour, this is supposed to be sprinkled on the chicken.

WILLIAM
Isn't there more to go up?

DAISY
Oh, please, it won't take a moment!

WILLIAM
All right, give it to me.

--
[00:21:18, EXT. DOWNTON ABBEY, GROUNDS - DAY]
[The mourners walk back to the house.]

GEORGE MURRAY
We ought to talk about the business of the entail. As you know, on your death the heir to the title inherits everything except for the sums set aside for your daughters and your widow.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Yes?

GEORGE MURRAY
Owing to the terms of her settlement, this will include the bulk of your wife's fortune.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM (sigh)
It has been our sole topic of conversation since the day the ship went down.

GEORGE MURRAY
Of course, it must seem horribly unjust to Lady Grantham, but that is how the law stands.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Is there really no way to detach her money from the estate? Even to me it seems absurd.

GEORGE MURRAY
Your father tied the knots pretty tight; I'd say it's unbreakable.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I see.

[Further back, Edith weeps into her handkerchief.]

LADY MARY
Really, Edith, do you have to put on such an exhibition?

LADY SYBIL
She's not.

LADY MARY
I was supposed to be engaged to him, for heaven's sake, not you, and I can control myself.

LADY EDITH
Then you should be ashamed.

--
[00:22:11, INT. KITCHENS - DAY]

MRS PATMORE
Oh, don't tell me you haven't sent up the egg yet!

[Daisy panics and rushes out with the bowl. She grabs Gwen in the corridor.]

DAISY
Oh, God! Help me! Please, God, help me!

GWEN
What on earth's the matter?

DAISY
Just run upstairs to the dining room and find William, I beg you!

GWEN
I can't do that now.

DAISY
You've got to. I'll be hanged if you don't.

GWEN
What?

WILLIAM
Daisy, is that you?

[William comes down the stairs with the bowl in his hand.]

WILLIAM
Is it the chicken in a sauce or the plain chicken with sliced oranges?

DAISY
Oh, thank you blessed and merciful Lord! Thank you!

[Daisy swaps the egg dish with the salt of sorrel that William's holding.]

DAISY
It's the chicken in the sauce. I'll never do anything sinful again, I swear it, not till I die!

[Gwen stares after Daisy in confusion.]

--
[00:22:45, EXT. DOWNTON ABBEY, FRONT WALK - DAY]
[Cora meets the mourning party at the front door.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Mr Murray, how lovely to see you. Do come in.

GEORGE MURRAY
You're very kind, Lady Grantham, but I must get back to London.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
But you'll stay for luncheon?

GEORGE MURRAY
Thank you, but no. I'll eat on the train. In fact, if you'd be so good as to ask for the motor to be brought 'round?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Mm.

[Robert turns to Carson, who nods.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
But didn't you want the afternoon to talk things through?

GEORGE MURRAY
I think we've said everything we have to say, haven't we, my lord?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Oh, for the time being, yes. Thank you, Murray. You've given me a good deal to think about.

[Murray turns to leave and Mary leads her sisters towards the house.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Mary, try to get everyone into the dining room. Edith, make sure old Lord Minturn sits down.

--
[00:23:23, INT. MR CARSON'S OFFICE - DAY]
[Someone knocks at the door as Carson decanters some wine.]

MR CARSON
Mm-hmm?

[Mrs Hughes enters.]

MRS HUGHES
They've all gone?

MR CARSON
They have, thank the Lord.

MRS HUGHES
What about the lawyer?

MR CARSON
Oh, he was the first away. Didn't even stay for the luncheon.

MRS HUGHES
I wish they'd make their minds up. Gwen's put clean sheets on the blue room bed. Now she'll just have to strip it again.

MR CARSON
Can't you leave it for the next guest?

MRS HUGHES
Well, only if you don't tell.

[Carson chuckles.]

MRS HUGHES
So...has it all been settled?

MR CARSON (sigh)
I don't know if anything's been settled. There's a fellow in Manchester with claims to the title, I gather, but it's all a long way from settled.

MRS HUGHES
You mustn't take it personally.

MR CARSON
Oh, I do take it personally, Mrs Hughes. I can't stand by and watch our family threatened with the loss of all they hold dear.

MRS HUGHES (chuckles)
They're not our family.

MR CARSON
Well, they're all the family I've got.

[Mrs Hughes is surprised and humbled by his sharp sincerity.]

MR CARSON
I beg your pardon.

MRS HUGHES
Do you...ever wish you'd...gone another way?

[Carson looks up sharply.]

MRS HUGHES
Worked in a shop or a factory? Had a wife and children?

MR CARSON
Do you?

MRS HUGHES
I don't know. Maybe. Sometimes.

[Someone knocks at the door.]

GWEN
William's laid tea in the library, but Her Ladyship hasn't come down.

MRS HUGHES
She'll be tired. Take a tray up to her bedroom.

[Gwen nods.]

MR CARSON
Is Thomas back?

GWEN
Not yet, Mr Carson.

[Mrs Hughes turns to Carson for an explanation.]

MR CARSON
He asked if he could run down the village, I didn't see why not.

--
[00:25:11, EXT. THE VILLAGE - DAY]
[Thomas exits a shop and walks down the street.]

--
[00:25:29, INT. LADY GRANTHAM'S BEDROOM - DAY]
[Gwen brings in a tea tray while O'Brien helps Cora dress. O'Brien waits for Gwen to leave.]

MISS O'BRIEN
It's iniquitous. They can't expect you to sit by silent as your fortune is stolen away.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Can't they?

MISS O'BRIEN
His Lordship'd never let it happen.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
How's Bates working out?

MISS O'BRIEN
Well, I don't like to say. Only, it seems unkind to criticize a man for an affliction, milady. And even if it means he can't do his job.

--
[00:26:08, INT. LIBRARY - DAY]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
How are you settling in?

MR BATES
Very well, I think. Unless Your Lordship feels differently.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
No complaints?

MR BATES
If I had any, I should take them to Mr Carson, milord, not you.

[Robert chuckles.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You're probably right. And the house hasn't worn you out with the endless stairs and everything?

MR BATES
I like the house, my lord, and I like it as a place to work.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
What happened?

MR BATES
Oh, it's only the old wound. After I left the army, I had a spot of bother and just when I got through that, about a year ago my knee started playing up. A bit of shrapnel got left in or something had moved, but it's fine. It's not a problem.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
And you'd let me know if you felt it was all too much for you?

MR BATES
I would. But it won't be.

--
[00:26:54, EXT. COURTYARD - DAY]
[Thomas returns while O'Brien is on her smoke break.]

SERVANT
Thomas.

MISS O'BRIEN
And where have you been?

THOMAS
In the village. Sent a telegram, if you must know.

MISS O'BRIEN
Oh, pardon me for living.

[She offers him a cigarette.]

MISS O'BRIEN
Well, Murray didn't stay long.

THOMAS
Does Her Ladyship know how they left it?

MISS O'BRIEN
No. They talked it all through on their way back from the church.

THOMAS
If I was still his valet, I'd get it out of him.

MISS O'BRIEN
Bates won't say a word.

THOMAS
He will not? I bet your tanner he's a spy in the other direction. I wanted that job. We were all right together, His Lordship and me.

MISS O'BRIEN
Then be sure to get your foot in the door when Bates is gone.

THOMAS
Can't get rid of him just 'cause he talks behind our backs.

MISS O'BRIEN
There's more than one way to skin a cat.

--
[00:27:49, INT. LADY MARY'S BEDROOM - EVENING]
[Anna fixes Mary's hair.]

ANNA
Perhaps she misunderstood.

LADY MARY
No, it was quite plain. O'Brien told her Bates can't do the job properly. Why was he taken on?

ANNA
Oh, he was Lord Grantham's batman when he was fighting the Boers.

LADY MARY
I know that, but even so.

LADY SYBIL
I think it's romantic.

LADY MARY
I don't. How can a valet do his work if he's lame?

ANNA
He's not very lame.

[Anna finishes Mary's hair.]

ANNA
There. Anything else before I go down?

LADY MARY
No, that's it. Thank you.

[Mary looks at herself in the full mirror as Anna exits.]

LADY MARY
Oh, I hate black.

LADY SYBIL
It's not for long. Mama says we can go into half-mourning next month and back to colours by September.

LADY MARY
It still seems a lot for a cousin.

LADY EDITH
But not a fiancé.

LADY MARY
He wasn't really a fiancé.

LADY EDITH
No? I thought that was what you call a man you're going to marry.

LADY MARY
I was only going to marry him if nothing better turned up.

LADY SYBIL
Mary, what a horrid thing to say.

LADY MARY
Don't worry, Edith would've taken him, wouldn't you?

LADY EDITH
Yes, I'd have taken him. If you had given me the chance, I'd have taken him like a shot.

--
[00:29:00, INT. SERVANTS' CORRIDOR - EVENING]

THOMAS
I just think you should know it's not working, Mr Carson.

MR CARSON
Do you mean Mr Bates is lazy?

THOMAS
Not lazy...exactly. But he just can't carry. He can hardly manage His Lordship's cases. You saw how it was when they went out to London for the memorial. He can't help with the guest luggage neither, and as for waiting a table, we can forget that.

MR CARSON
And what do you want me to do?

THOMAS
Well, it's not for me to say. But is it fair on William to have all the extra work? I don't believe you'd like to think the house was falling below the way things ought to be.

MR CARSON
I would not.

THOMAS
That's all I'm saying.

--
[00:29:37, INT. LADY MARY'S BEDROOM - EVENING]
[Mary stares at her reflection in the looking glass. Sybil pops her head in.]

LADY SYBIL
I'm going down. Coming?

LADY MARY
In a moment. You go.

[Sybil enters and closes the door.]

LADY SYBIL
I know you're sad about Patrick. Whatever you say, I know it.

LADY MARY
You're a darling. But you see, I'm not as sad as I should be. And that's what makes me sad.

--
[00:30:10, INT. LORD GRANTHAM'S DRESSING ROOM - EVENING]
[Bates brushes down Robert's tailcoat.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Thank you.

[Bates drops the brush.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I'll do that.

MR BATES
No. No, thank you, milord. I can do it.

[Bates picks up the brush.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I'm sure.

MR BATES
I hope so, milord. I hope you are sure.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Bates, we have to be sensible. I won't be doing you a favour in the long run if it's too much for you. No matter what we've been through, it's got to work.

MR BATES
Of course it has, sir. I mean, milord.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Do you miss the army, Bates?

MR BATES
I miss a lot of things, but you have to keep moving, don't you?

[Robert chuckles.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You do, indeed.

MR BATES
I'll show you, milord, I promise. I won't let you down. We've managed so far, haven't we?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Yes, we have. Of course we have.

--
[00:30:51, INT. LADY GRANTHAM'S BEDROOM - EVENING]
[Robert knocks and enters.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You look very nice.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Thank you, darling. Did Murray make matters clearer?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Yes, I'm afraid he did.

[Cora is disappointed, but she waits for O'Brien to leave before speaking.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
By the way, O'Brien says Bates is causing a lot of awkwardness downstairs. You may have to do something about it.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
She's always making trouble.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Is that fair? When she hasn't mentioned it before now.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I don't know why you listen to her.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
It is quite eccentric, even for you, to have a cripple valet.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Please...don't use that word.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Did he tell you he couldn't walk when he made his application?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Don't exaggerate.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Doesn't it strike you as dishonest not to mention it?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I knew he'd been wounded.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
You never said.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You know I don't care to talk about all that.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Of course, I understand what it must be like to have fought alongside someone in a war.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Oh, you understand that, do you?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Certainly I do. You must form the most tremendous bonds. Even with a servant.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Really? "Even with a servant"?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Oh, Robert, don't catch me out. I'm simply saying I fully see why you want to help him.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
But?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
But...is this the right way? To employ him for a job he can't do? Is it any wonder the others noses are put out?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I just want to give him a chance.

[Cora sighs.]

--
[00:32:19, INT. DRAWING ROOM - EVENING]
[Robert enters to find Violet looking out a window.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Mama, I'm sorry. No one told me you were here.

[Violet turns around and opens her decorative fan to block the light coming from the electric chandelier.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Such a glare. I feel as if I were on stage at the Gaiety.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
We're used to it. I do wish you'd let me install it in the Dower House; it's very convenient. The man who manages the generator could look after yours as well.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
No. I couldn't have electricity in the house. I wouldn't sleep a wink. All those vapours seeping about.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Even Cora won't have it in the bedroom. She did wonder about the kitchens, but I couldn't see the point.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Well, before anyone joins us, I'm glad of this chance for a little talk.

[They sit.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I gather Murray was here today?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
News travels fast. Yes, I saw him, and he's not optimistic that there's anything we can do.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Well, I refuse to believe it.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Be that as it may, it's a fact.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
But to lose Cora's fortune!

[Robert scoffs and stands up.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Really, Mama, you know as well as I do that Cora's fortune is not Cora's fortune anymore. Thanks to Papa it is now part of the estate, and the estate is entailed to my heir. That is it. That is all of it.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Robert, dear, I don't mean to sound harsh--

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You may not mean to, but I bet you will.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Twenty-four years ago, you married Cora against my wishes for her money! Give it away now, what was the point of your peculiar marriage in the first place?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
If I were to tell you she's made me very happy, would that stretch belief?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
It's not why you chose her...above all those other girls who could've filled my shoes so easily.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
If you must know, when I think of my motives for pursuing Cora, I'm ashamed. There's no need to remind me of them.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Don't you care about Downton?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
What do you think? I've given my life to Downton. I was born here, and I hope to die here. I claim no career beyond the nurture of this house and the estate. It is my third parent and my fourth child. Do I care about it? Yes, I do care!

[Someone enters and Violet gives him a shushing expression.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I hope I don't hear sounds of a disagreement.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
What? Is that what they call discussion in New York?

LADY MARY
Well, I'm glad you're fighting. I'm glad somebody's putting up a fight

LADY SYBIL
You're not really fighting Granny, are you, Papa?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Your grandmother merely wishes to do the right thing. And so do I.

[Carson enters.]

MR CARSON
Dinner is served, my lady.

--
[00:34:40, INT. KITCHENS - EVENING]

DAISY
Does anyone else keep dreaming about the Titanic? I can't get it out of my mind.

GWEN
Not again. Give it a rest.

ANNA
Daisy, it's time to let it go.

DAISY
But all them people freezing to death in midnight icy water.

MISS O'BRIEN
Oh, you sound like a penny dreadful.

GWEN
I expect you saw worse things in South Africa, eh Mr Bates?

MR BATES
Not worse, but pretty bad.

DAISY
Did you enjoy the war?

MR BATES
I don't think anyone enjoys war, but there are some good memories, too.

ANNA
I'm sure there are.

GWEN
Mr Bates, could you hand me that tray?

[Mr Bates gets up to grab it, but his knee twinges and he spills the whole contents on the floor as he grabs his knee. Anna gets up quickly.]

ANNA
I'll do it.

[Gwen clearly feels awkward.]

MR CARSON
Ladies are out. We've given them coffee. His Lordship's taken his port to the library. Anna, Gwen, go up and help clear away. Er, Daisy, tell Mrs Patmore we'll eat in 15 minutes.

[Mr Bates, Mr Carson, and Miss O'Brien sit at the table.]

--
[00:35:43, INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING]
[The servants clear the table.]

GWEN
I keep forgetting, does this go next door or back to the kitchen?

THOMAS
Those go back, but the dessert service and all the glasses stay in the upstairs pantry.

WILLIAM
Put it on here.

[Gwen sets the dish down on the tray. O'Brien creeps up to Thomas in the antechamber.]

THOMAS
What is it?

MISS O'BRIEN
Her Ladyship's told him she thinks Mr Bates ought to go. She said to me, "If only His Lordship had been content with Thomas."

THOMAS
Did she really?

ANNA
What are you doing up here?

MISS O'BRIEN
It's a free country.

ANNA
Well, I'm going for my dinner. You two can stay here...plotting.

--
[00:36:23, INT. THE DOWER HOUSE - DAY]
[Violet holds a letter.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
So, the young Duke of Crowborough is asking himself to stay.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
We know why?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
You hope you know why. That is not at all the same. You realise the duke thinks Mary's prospects have altered?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I suppose so.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
There's no suppose about it. Of course, this is exactly the sort of opportunity that will come to Mary if we can only get things settled in her favour. Is Robert coming 'round?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Not yet. To him, the risk is we succeed in saving my money, but not the estate. He feels he'd be betraying his duty if Downton were lost because of him.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Well, I'm going to write to Murray.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
He won't say anything different.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Well, we have to start somewhere. Our duty is to Mary. Well, give him a date for when Mary's out of mourning.

[Violet hands the letter back to Cora.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
No one wants to kiss a girl in black.

--
[00:37:30, INT. LADY MARY'S BEDROOM - DAY]
[Sybil puts a flower in Mary's hair as they stand in front of the mirror.]

LADY EDITH
Oh, do stop admiring yourself. He's not marrying you for your looks. That's if he wants to marry you at all.

LADY MARY
He will.

LADY SYBIL
You look beautiful.

LADY MARY
Thank you Sybil, darling.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
We should go down. They'll be back from the station at any moment.

[The girls file out.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Let's not gild the lily, dear.

[Cora takes the flower out of Mary's hair and lowers her voice to a whisper.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
And Mary, try to look surprised.

--
[00:37:57, INT. SERVANTS' CORRIDOR - DAY]

MR CARSON
You all ready?

[Carson inspects William's uniform.]

MR CARSON
Very well. We shall go out to greet them.

DAISY
And me, Mr Carson?

MR CARSON
No, Daisy, no you.

[Daisy's expression falls.]

MR CARSON
Can you manage, Mr Bates, or would you rather wait here?

MR BATES
I want to go, Mr Carson.

MR CARSON
There's no obligation for the whole staff to be present.

MR BATES
I'd like to be there.

MR CARSON
Well, it's certainly a great day for Downton to welcome a duke under our roof.

THOMAS (to William)
Remember to help me with the luggage. Don't go running off.

MR BATES
I'll give you a hand.

THOMAS
Oh, I couldn't ask that, Mr Bates, not in your condition.

[The servants head upstairs and Thomas turns to Mr Carson.]

THOMAS
How long do we have to put up with this, Mr Carson, just so I know?

--
[00:38:35, EXT. DOWNTON ABBEY, FRONT WALK - DAY]
[The servants line up and the family exits the house. William opens the car door for the duke and Robert.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Welcome to Downton.

[Mrs Hughes and the housemaids curtsy and the men bow their heads.]

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Lady Grantham, this is so kind of you.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Not at all, Duke. I'm delighted you could spare the time. You know my daughter, Mary, of course.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Of course, Lady Mary.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
And Edith, but I don't believe you've met my youngest, Sybil.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Ah, Lady Sybil.

[They step forward to shake hands.]

LADY SYBIL
How do you do?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Come on in, you must be worn out.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Oh, Lady Grantham, I have a confession to make, which I hope won't cause too much bother. My man was taken ill just as I was leaving, so...

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Oh, well, that won't be a problem, will it Carson?

MR CARSON
Certainly not. I shall look after His Grace myself.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Oh, no, I wouldn't dream of being such a nuisance, surely a footman...

[The duke looks at Thomas.]

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
I remember this man. Didn't you serve me when I dined with Lady Grantham in London?

THOMAS
I did, Your Grace.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Ah, there we are. We shall do very well together, won't we...?

THOMAS
Er, Thomas, Your Grace.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
...Thomas.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Good.

[The family heads inside.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I hope you had a pleasant journey.

[O'Brien kicks Bates's cane out from under him and he falls.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Bates, are you all right?

MR BATES
Perfectly, my lord. I apologise.

[The family continues inside and Bates looks up at O'Brien. Anna crouches down to help Bates.]

ANNA
Mr Bates.

[William closes the front door and Anna helps Bates to his feet.]

ANNA
That's better.

MR BATES
Please, don't feel sorry for me.

[Bates and Anna walk around to the servants' entrance behind the others.]

--
[00:40:26, INT. CORRIDOR - DAY]

LADY MARY
What shall we do? What would you like to do?

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
I think I'd rather like to go exploring.

LADY MARY
Certainly. Gardens or house?

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Oh, house, I think. Gardens are all the same to me.

[They chuckle.]

LADY MARY
Very well. We can begin in the hall, which is one of the oldest--

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
No, not all those drawing rooms and libraries.

LADY MARY
Well what, then?

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
I don't know. The...the secret passages and the attics.

LADY MARY
It seems a bit odd, but why not? I'll just tell Mama.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
No Don't tell your mama.

LADY MARY
But there's nothing wrong in it.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
No, indeed, I'm--I'm only worried the others will want to join us.

[Mary smiles, flattered.]

--
[00:41:17, INT. DRAWING ROOM - DAY]
[Robert enters while Cora is embroidering.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Mary's settling him in.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Cora, don't let Mary make a fool of herself. By the way, I'll be going up to London next week.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Do you want to open the house?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
No, no, I'll just take Bates and stay at a club. I won't be more than a day or two.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I see. Are things...progressing?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
What "things"?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Oomph.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
It's just a regimental dinner

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
It's a pity Bates spoiled the arrival this afternoon.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
He didn't spoil anything. He fell over.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
So undignified. Carson hates that kind of thing.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I don't care what Carson thinks.

[Carson clears his throat.]

MR CARSON
A message from the Dowager Countess, milady. She says she won't come to tea, but she'll join you for dinner.

[Cora gives Robert a slightly exasperated look.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Oh, Carson, I hope you weren't embarrassed this afternoon. I can assure you the Duke very much appreciated his welcome.

MR CARSON
I'm glad.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Is Bates all right?

MR CARSON
I think so, my lord.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Must be so difficult for you all the same.

[Carson looks at the floor and raises his eyebrows and leaves without a word.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Don't stir.

--
[00:42:36, INT. SERVANTS' BEDROOM CORRIDOR - DAY]
[Mary and the duke sneak through the servants' passages.]

LADY MARY
Do you realise this is the first time we've ever been alone?

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Then you've forgotten when I pulled you into the conservatory at the Northbrooks.

[Mary smiles.]

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
How sad.

LADY MARY
No, I haven't. It's not quite the same with twenty chaperones hiding behind every fern.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
And are you pleased to be alone with me, my lady?

LADY MARY
Oh dear, if I answer truthfully you'll think me rather forward.

[The duke steps forward to open the door behind Mary.]

LADY MARY
I don't think we should pry. It feels rather...disrespectful.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Oh, nonsense. It's your father's house, isn't it? You have a right to know what goes on in it. Where does this lead?

LADY MARY
To the men's quarters, with a lock on the women's side. Only Mrs Hughes is allowed to turn it.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Mrs Hughes...

[The duke opens the door.]

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
And you.

[Mary and the duke enter the men's corridor.]

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
In here?

LADY MARY
A footman, I imagine.

[Mary seems uncomfortable as the duke opens the door and then enters another room. The duke rifles through the dresser drawers.]

LADY MARY
Should you do that?

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Why not? I'm--I'm making a study on the genus footman. I seek to know the creature's ways.

[Mary laughs, then turns when she hears something.]

LADY MARY (whisper)
Someone's coming!

[Mary stands awkwardly in the corridor and the duke closes the footman's bedroom door as Bates steps out of his room into the corridor.]

MR BATES
Can I help you, milady?

LADY MARY
We were just exploring.

[The duke steps out of the footman's room.]

MR BATES
Were you looking for Thomas, Your Grace?

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
No, as Lady Mary said, we've just been exploring.

[Bates nods and opens his door.]

MR BATES
Would you care to explore my room, milady?

[Mary is embarrassed and ashamed.]

LADY MARY
Of course not, Bates. I'm sorry to have bothered you. We were just going down.

[Mary walks stiffly back to the women's corridor and the duke follows calmly behind and she locks the door.]

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Why did you apologise to that man? It's not his business what we do.

LADY MARY
I always apologise when I'm in the wrong. It's a habit of mine.

--
[00:44:57, INT. LIBRARY - DAY]

MR CARSON
The plain fact is Mr Bates, through no fault of his own, is not able to fulfil the extra duties expected of him. He can't lift, he can't serve at table, he's dropping things all over the place. On a night like tonight, he should act as a third footman. As it is, my lord, we may have to have a maid in the dining room.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Cheer up, Carson. There are worse thing happening in the world.

MR CARSON
Not worse than a maid serving a duke.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
So you're quite determined?

MR CARSON
It's a hard decision, Your Lordship, a very hard decision, but the honour of Downton is at stake.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Don't worry, Carson, I know all about hard decisions when it comes to the honour of Downton. Don't I boy?

[Robert kneels down to pet his dog.]

--
[00:45:47, INT. LUGGAGE ROOM - EVENING]
[William sighs with the effort as he puts down some luggage.]

MRS HUGHES
William, you mustn't let Thomas take advantage. He's only a footman, same as you.

WILLIAM
Well, that's all right, Mrs Hughes. I like to keep busy. Takes your mind off things.

MRS HUGHES
What things have you got to take your mind off? If you're feeling homesick, there's no shame in it.

WILLIAM
No.

MRS HUGHES
Means you come from a happy home. There's plenty of people here would envy that.

WILLIAM
Yes, Mrs Hughes.

--
[00:46:28, INT. LORD GRANTHAM'S DRESSING ROOM - EVENING]

MR BATES
Will that be all, milord?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Yes. That is...not exactly. Have you recovered from your fall this afternoon?

MR BATES
I'm very sorry about that, milord. I don't know what happened.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
The thing is, Bates, I said I'd give you a trial and I have. If it were only up to me. It's this question of a valet's extra duties.

MR BATES
You mean waiting a table when there's a large party.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
That and carrying things and...you do see that Carson can't be expected to compromise the efficiency of his staff.

MR BATES
I do, milord, of course I do. Might I make a suggestion? That when an extra footman is required, the cost could come out of my wages.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Absolutely not. I couldn't possibly allow that.

MR BATES
Because I am very eager to stay, milord. Very eager, indeed.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I know you are. And I was eager that this should work.

MR BATES
You see...it is unlikely that I should find another position.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
But surely in a smaller house where less is expected of you...

MR BATES
It's not likely.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I mean to help until you find something.

MR BATES
I couldn't take your money, milord. I can take wages for a job done, that's all.

[They regard each other for a moment.]

MR BATES
Very good, milord. I'll go at once.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
There's no need to rush out into the night. Take the London train tomorrow; it leaves at nine. You'll have a month's wages, too.

[Bates is about to protest.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
That I insist on.

[Bates begins to leave.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
It's a bloody business, Bates, but I can't see any way around it.

MR BATES
I quite understand, milord.

[BREAK 3]

ACT FOUR
[00:48:28, INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I'm afraid we're rather a female party tonight, Duke, but you know what it's like trying to balance numbers in the country. A single man outranks the Holy Grail.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
No, I'm ter-- I'm terribly flattered to be dining en famille.

LADY EDITH
What were you and Mary doing in the attics this afternoon?

LADY SYBIL
I expect Mary was just showing the duke the house, weren't you?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Are you a student of architecture?

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Mm, absolutely.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Then I do hope you'll come and inspect my little cottage. It was designed by Rein...

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Ah.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
...for the first earl's sister.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
The attics?

LADY EDITH
Yes. Mary took the duke up to the attics.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Whatever for?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Why was this, dear?

LADY MARY
We were just looking around.

LADY EDITH
Looking around? What is there to look at but servants' rooms? What was the real reason?

[Thomas is interested by the conversation.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM (chuckles uncomfortably)
Don't be such a chatterbox, Edith.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I think we'll go through.

LADY EDITH
I still don't understand--

LADY MARY
Will you hold your tongue?

[The men rise as the women exit in order of age.]

--
[00:49:44, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - EVENING]

THOMAS
How long do you think they'll be? I'm starving.

MR CARSON
Have you settled the ladies?

THOMAS
Yes, Mr Carson.

MR CARSON
Then it won't be long once they go through.

DAISY
Do you think he'll speak out? Do you think we'll have a duchess to wait on? Imagine that!

MRS PATMORE
You won't be waiting on her, whatever happens.

MR CARSON
There is no reason why the eldest daughter and heiress of the Earl of Grantham should not wear a duchess's coronet with honour.

MRS HUGHES
Heiress, Mr Carson? Has it been decided?

MR CARSON
It will be if there's any justice in the world.

MRS HUGHES
Well, we'll know soon enough.

[Anna puts a plate down on a tray.]

MRS PATMORE
What you doing, Anna?

ANNA
I thought I'd take something up to Mr Bates, him not being well enough to come down. You don't mind, do you Mrs Hughes?

MRS HUGHES
I don't mind, not this once.

MR CARSON
Take him whatever he might need.

[Anna leaves with the tray.]

MR CARSON
Mr Bates is leaving without a stain on his character. I hope you all observe that in the manner of your parting.

WILLIAM
Well, I don't see why he has to go. I don't mind doing a bit of extra work.

THOMAS
It's not up to you. I'll take care of His Lordship, shall I Mr Carson?

MR CARSON
Not while you're looking after the duke, you won't. I'll see to His Lordship myself.

--
[00:50:51, INT. SERVANTS' BEDROOM CORRIDOR - EVENING]
[Anna takes the tray to Mr Bates's room and sees him crying through the slightly open door. She takes a step back and pauses to consider.]

ANNA
Mr Bates? Are you there?

[Bates wipes his eyes with a cloth and comes to the door.]

ANNA
I brought something up in case you're hungry.

MR BATES
That's very kind.

[Bates puts his cane on his arm and takes the tray and puts it down on a table by the door.]

ANNA
I'm ever so sorry you're going.

MR BATES
I'll be all right.

ANNA
Of course you will. There's always a place for a man like you.

MR BATES
Oh, yes. Something'll turn up.

ANNA
Tell us when you're fixed. Just...drop us a line. Else I'll worry.

MR BATES
Well...we can't have that.

[They smile sadly at each other and Bates closes the door.]

--
[00:52:44, INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
We must go and let the servants get in here.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
I should be grateful if we could stay just a minute more. I have-- I have something to ask you.

[Robert sits back down.]

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
I was terribly sorry to hear about your cousins.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You said. Did you know them?

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Not well. I--I used to see Patrick Crawley at the odd thing. I imagine it will mean some adjustments for your...to lose two heirs in one night is terrible.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Indeed, it was terrible.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Awful. But then again, it's an ill wind. At least Lady Mary's prospects must have rather improved.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Have they?

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Haven't they?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I will not be coy and pretend I do not understand your meaning, though you seem very informed on this family's private affairs. But you ought, perhaps, to know that I do not intend to fight the entail. Not any part of it.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
You can't be serious.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
It pains me to say it, but I am.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
You will give up your entire estate - your wife's money into the bargain - to a perfect stranger? You won't even put up a fight?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I hope he proves to be perfect, but I rather doubt it.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Ha. A very odd thing to joke about.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
No odder than this conversation. So, there you have it. But Mary will still have her settlement, which you won't find ungenerous.

[The duke coughs.]

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
I'm--I'm sorry?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I only meant that her portion, when she marries will be more than respectable. You'll be pleased, I promise you.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Oh, heavens. I--I hope I haven't given the wrong impression.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You know very well the impression--

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
My dear Lord Grantham--

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Don't "my dear Lord Grantham" me! You knew what you were doing when you came here. You encouraged Mary, all of us to thinking--

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Forgive me, but I came to express my sympathies and my friendship, nothing more. L--Lady Mary's a charming person. Whoever marries her will be a lucky man. He will not, however, be me.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I see. And what was it you asked me to stay behind to hear?

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
I forget.

[Robert glares at the duke.]

--
[00:55:27, INT. GREAT HALL - EVENING]
[The duke and Robert part ways. Mary waits for the duke as he lights a candle by the stairs.]

LADY MARY
Well, aren't you coming into the drawing room?

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
I'm--I'm tired. I--I think I'll just slip away. Please make my excuses.

LADY MARY
I'm afraid I've worn you out. Tomorrow we can just--

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
I'm leaving in the morning. Goodnight.

[Mary is disappointed. The duke turns around.]

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Oh, you might tell that footman...

LADY MARY
Thomas.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Thomas. You might tell him I've gone up.

[The duke ascends the stairs and Mary processes her disappointment, trying not to cry. Edith approaches from behind to gloat.]

LADY EDITH
So he slipped the hook.

LADY MARY
At least I'm not fishing with no bait.

[Mary exits, leaving Edith equally upset.]

[BREAK 4]

--
ACT FIVE
[00:56:32, INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT]

THOMAS
I don't believe that.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Well, believe what you like. He won't break the entail. The unknown cousin gets everything and Mary's inheritance will be the same as it always was.

THOMAS
Well, how was I to know when the lawyer turned up?

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
You weren't to know. You did the right thing to telegraph me. It's just not gonna come off.

THOMAS
So, what now?

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Well, you-- you know how I'm fixed. I have to have an heiress. If it means going to New York to find one.

THOMAS
What about me?

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
You...you will wish me well.

THOMAS
You said you'd find me a job if I wanted to leave.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Do you?

THOMAS
I want to be a valet. I'm sick of being a footman.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Yeah, Thomas, I don't need a valet. I--I thought you were getting rid of the new one here?

THOMAS
I'll have done it, but I'm not sure Carson's gonna let me take over.

[Thomas sits down and takes the duke's face in his hand.]

THOMAS
And I want to be with you.

[They kiss.]

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
I just can't see it working, can you? We don't seem to have the basis of a servant/master relationship, do we?

THOMAS
You came here to be with me.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Among other reasons. And one swallow doesn't make a summer.

THOMAS
Aren't you forgetting something?

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
What? Are you threatening me? Because of a youthful dalliance? A few-- a few weeks of madness in a London season? You wouldn't hold that against me, surely?

THOMAS
I would if I have to.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
And who will believe a greedy footman over the words of a duke? If you're not careful, you'll end up behind bars.

THOMAS
I've got proof.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Mm. You mean these?

[The duke pulls out a bound stack of letters. Thomas dashes for them, but the duke throws them in the fire and wrestles keeps Thomas away as they burn.]

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
You know, my mother's always telling me, "Never put anything in writing." And now, thanks to you, I never will again.

THOMAS
How did you get that? You bastard.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Don't be a bad loser, Thomas. Go to bed. Unless you want to stay.

[Thomas leaves angry.]

--
[01:00:04, INT. MRS HUGHES'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT]
[Mr Carson knocks on the open door.]

MR CARSON
I think I'll turn in.

MRS HUGHES
No big announcement, then?

MR CARSON
No. Nor likely to be. He's off on the nine o'clock train.

MRS HUGHES
He never is. And when we've had a turkey killed for tomorrow's dinner. Well, I wonder what she did wrong.

MR CARSON
She did nothing wrong, not from the way His Lordship was talking.

MRS HUGHES
So His Grace turned out to be graceless. Hm.

MR CARSON
Goodnight, Mrs Hughes.

MRS HUGHES
Goodnight, Mr Carson.

--
[01:00:38, INT. LADY GRANTHAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
If you knew that was your decision, why put Mary through it?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
But I didn't know it was my decision, my final decision, until tonight. But I find I cannot ruin the estate or hollow out the title for the sake of Mary, even with a better man than that.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I try to understand, I just can't.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Why should you? Downton is in my blood and in my bones. It's not in yours. And I can no more be the cause of its destruction than I could betray my country. Besides, how was I to know he wouldn't take her without the money?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Don't pretend to be a child because it suits you.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Do you think she would've been happy with a fortune hunter?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
She might've been. I was.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Have you been happy? Really, have I made you happy?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Yes. That is, since you fell in love with me. Which, if I remember correctly, was about a year after we were married.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Not a year. Not as long as that. But it wouldn't have happened for Mary.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Why not?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Because I am so much nicer than the Duke of Crowborough.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I'll be the judge of that.

[Cora turns off the light.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Just don't think I'm going to let it rest, Robert. I haven't given up by any means.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I must do what my conscience tells me.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
And so must I. And I don't want you to think I'll let it rest.

[Robert blows out the candle on his side of the bed.]

--
[01:02:16, INT. GREAT HALL - MORNING]

MR CARSON
My lord, would it be acceptable for Bates to ride in front with Taylor? Otherwise it means getting the other car out. He and His Grace are catching the same train.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Perfectly acceptable. And if His Grace doesn't, he can lump it.

[Carson is pleased by Robert's response.]

--
[01:02:35, EXT. DOWNTON ABBEY, FRONT WALK - MORNING]
[Bates takes a last look at the house. The duke exits the house with Cora.]

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
You've been so kind, Lady Grantham, thank you.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Goodbye, Duke.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
You will make my farewells to your delightful daughters?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
They'd have been down if they'd known you were leaving so soon.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Alas, s--something's come up which has taken me quite by surprise.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Obviously.

[Robert joins them.]

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Well, Grantham, this has been a highly enjoyable interlude.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Has it? And I feared it had proved a disappointment.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
Not at all. Not at all, a short stay in your lovely house has driven away my cares.

[Thomas glares at the duke.]

CHAUFFEUR
We ought to go, my lord, if His Grace is to catch the train.

[The duke gets in the motor. Robert approaches Bates.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Goodbye, Bates. And good luck.

MR BATES
Good luck to you, my lord.

[Robert is discomfited as Bates gets in the motorcar. The chauffeur begins to drive away and Robert turns from heading inside to run after the car.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Wait!

[Carson walks briskly towards the car as Robert takes Bates's travel bag.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Get out, Bates.

DUKE OF CROWBOROUGH
I--I really mustn't be late.

[Robert ignores the duke.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Get back inside and we'll say no more about it.

[Bates takes his bag from Robert and heads inside. Robert closes the car door and watches Bates walk back to the house.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
It wasn't right, Carson. I just didn't think it was right.

--
[01:04:20,INT. MANCHESTER, CRAWLEY'S HOUSE - MORNING]
[Matthew Crawley and his mother, Isobel, are eating breakfast. A housemaid brings Isobel the post.]

ELLEN
First post, ma'am.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Thank you, Emma. One for you.

[Isobel hands a letter to Matthew.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Mm. Thank you, Mother.

[Matthew opens the letter.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
It's from Lord Grantham.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Really? What on earth does he want?

[Matthew's jaw drops as he continues reading.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
He wants to change our lives.
