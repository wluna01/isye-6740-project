MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Is there any news of Sybil?

LADY MARY
She's still not coming. She insists they can't afford it.

[Matthew raises his eyebrows with an understanding frown and nods.]

ARCHBISHOP
Mr Travis, can we move forward?

REVEREND TRAVIS
If I could just ask you to come down the aisle again.

[Matthew and Mary nod pleasantly to Rev. Travis and smile at each other as they turn toward the door.]

REVEREND TRAVIS
Can we get the troops organized?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
That means me.

[Robert rises from the pew.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
It seems rather hard on poor old Travis when he's doing all the work but the archbishop gets the glory.

MARY
Papa was the one who wanted a prince of the church. I'd have settled for Travis.

ROBERT
Mm.

MARY
Is there really no way we can get Sybil over? It seems ridiculous.

ROBERT
On the contrary, it's a relief. Branson is still an object of fascination for the county. We'll ask him here when we can prepare the servants and manage it gently.

[Robert and Mary walk to the back of the church.]

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
He's making a problem where none exists. No one could care less were Branson at the wedding or not.

MATTHEW
You must think country life more exciting than it is if you imagine people don't care when an earl's daughter runs off with the chauffeur.

ISOBEL
Well, the fact remains she has run off with the chauffeur and they'll have to get used to it.

[The archbishop calls down the aisle.]

ARCHBISHOP
Mr Travis, are we ready?

REVEREND TRAVIS
Er, any moment, Your Grace, any moment.

[Travis walks back up the aisle.]

REVEREND TRAVIS
Can we, please?

[Mary and Robert stand ready and take each other's arm before starting down the aisle.]

--
[00:01:49, EXT. DOWNTON GROUNDS - DAY]
[Daisy rides toward the house on her bicycle.]

--
[00:01:59, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - DAY]
[The servants sit down to eat.]

MR CARSON
That treacle tart just hit the spot, thank you, Mrs Patmore.

MRS PATMORE
So, Mrs Hughes and Anna are getting the place ready to let?

MR CARSON
That is the plan.

[Mrs Patmore nods and leaves with a tray.]

THOMAS BARROW
I'm surprised Anna held onto that house. I thought they confiscated the profits of murder.

MR CARSON
Mr Bates had the wisdom to transfer it to her before the trial.

THOMAS
I don't think I'd have allowed it, Mr Carson.

MR CARSON
Then we must all be grateful you were not the presiding judge.

THOMAS
I still think it's funny given that he's a convicted murderer.

MR CARSON
May I remind you, Mr Barrow, that in this house Mr Bates is a wronged man seeking justice. If you have any problems with that definition, I suggest you eat in the yard.

[Carson leaves. O'Brien gives Thomas a unpleasant look as he smirks at her.]

--
[00:02:40, INT. THE DOWER HOUSE - DAY]

ISOBEL
I suppose you agree with Robert.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Then, not for the first time, you suppose wrongly. The family must never be a topic of conversation.

CORA
I'm afraid Sybil's already made the Crawleys a permanent topic.

VIOLET
All the more reason. If we can show the county he can behave normally, they will soon lose interest in him. And I shall make sure he behaves normally, because I shall hold his hand on the radiator until he does.

[Cora smiles at the half-serious remark.]

ISOBEL
Well, I don't know this young man aside from "Good morning" and "Good night," but he strikes me as a very interesting addition to the family.

VIOLET
Oh, here we go.

[Violet shakes her head.]

ISOBEL
And why should he be "normal," as you call it? I say he should come here and fight his corner.

[Violet looks sharply to Cora for sympathy, but Cora keeps a neutral expression.]

ISOBEL
I like a man of strong beliefs. I think I'll send them the money.

CORA
Please don't. Robert's expressly forbidden it. He'd be furious.

[Violet looks between her two guests with a surprised expression.]

--
[00:03:32, INT. FRONT HALL - EVENING]
[Robert speaks on the telephone dressed in his tails.]

ROBERT
But it can't be as bad as...

[Robert listens.]

ROBERT
Look, I'll come and see you. Tomorrow. No, I insist. Right, goodbye.

[Robert hangs up the phone just as Mary enters dressed for dinner.]

MARY
Papa? What's the matter?

ROBERT (unconvincingly)
Nothing's the matter. What should be the matter?

[Robert exits and Mary watches him leave, wondering what's bothering him.]

--
[00:03:56, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - EVENING]
[Anna and Mrs Hughes enter and Carson and the other servants who were sitting at the table stand.]

MR CARSON
How was London?

ANNA BATES
We got it all done. But I couldn't have managed without my helper.

MRS PATMORE
Have you eaten?

MRS HUGHES
We had a bite on the train.

MRS PATMORE
Oh, sit down anyway, have a cup o' tea.

[The other servants sit down and Daisy and a maid leave.]

MRS HUGHES
I'll start on the final lists for the wedding tomorrow morning.

[Thomas holds Mrs Hughes chair for her and then sits down, too.]

MR CARSON
I've got the last of the wine deliveries coming on Tuesday.

MRS HUGHES
How will you manage without a footman?

MR CARSON
I agree, but I haven't time to find one now.

MISS SARAH O'BRIEN
I've had a letter from my sister asking after a job for her son, and--

MR CARSON
Miss O'Brien, we are about to host a society wedding. I have no time for training young hobbledehoys.

[A bell rings.]

MR CARSON
Her Ladyship is ringing.

[O'Brien pauses for a moment, then gets up to see to her duties. Mrs Hughes and Mr Carson share a look.]

--
[00:04:43, INT. LADY GRANTHAM'S BEDROOM - EVENING]
[O'Brien fixes Cora's hair as Cora sits in a dressing gown.]

CORA
Well, I don't see why not. I'll ask His Lordship when--

[The door opens and Robert enters in his dressing gown.]

CORA
There you are. So, I'll ask you now.

ROBERT
Ask me what?

CORA
Carson's in need of a footman and O'Brien has a candidate.

O'BRIEN
Alfred. Alfred Nugent, milord. He's a good worker.

CORA
I think it sounds perfect.

[Robert stares into space.]

CORA
Robert?

[Robert snaps out of his reverie.]

ROBERT
Whatever you say.

[Cora and O'Brien smile at each other.]

ROBERT
My dear, I have to go up to London tomorrow. I'll be catching the early train.

CORA
That's very sudden. Do you want me to open the house?

ROBERT
No, I'll come straight back.

CORA
What are you going for?

ROBERT
It's nothing to bother you with.

[Cora accepts his answer happily and Robert goes back into his thoughts.]

--
[00:05:18, EXT/INT. PRISON - DAY]
[Anna pauses to brace herself outside of Bates's prison before entering.]

ANNA
It's all there, every entry.

JOHN BATES
Where did you find the book?

ANNA
Behind the bureau. We moved it out to clean and there it was. Vera must have dropped it or something.

BATES
So, what do you want me to do?

ANNA
Make notes on all the names: close friend, relation, workmate, tradesman, and so on. Then I'll copy those and I'll send them with the book to Mr Murray.

BATES
Haven't you anything better to do?

ANNA (smiles)
I have not. Because I'd rather work to get you free then dine with the king at Buckingham Palace. So, what news have you got?

BATES
And what news could I have in here? Oh, I've acquired a new cellmate. To be honest, I'm not sure about him.

ANNA
Well, just remember what my mother used to say: never make an enemy by accident. Now, do you think you can get the notes done before my next visit?

BATES
I don't see what can come of it.

ANNA
Probably nothing. And my next idea will probably lead to nothing, and the next, and the next. But one day, something will occur to us and we'll follow it up, and the case against you will crumble.

BATES
Do you never doubt? For just one minute?

[Anna smiles softly.]

BATES
I wouldn't blame you.

ANNA
No. I don't doubt that the sun will rise in the east either.

--
[00:07:01, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - DAY]
[Mr Carson inspects Alfred with furrowed eyebrows, frowning up at him.]

MR CARSON
You're too tall to be a footman. No footman should be over six-foot-one.

[Thomas, Mrs Hughes, Daisy, and O'Brien stare at the other end of the room.]

O'BRIEN (proudly)
That can't be, can it? Since he's already been taken on.

MR CARSON
But what have you done?

ALFRED NUGENT
I was a hotel waiter after I was discharged from the army. [?] got back.

O'BRIEN
I think to get a job as a waiter shows real initiative.

MRS HUGHES
I suppose he can speak for himself?

O'BRIEN
Why? Is he on trial? This isn't an interview, is it? Not when he's already got the job.

MR CARSON
No, it is not an interview, Miss O'Brien, but he is on trial, and if he cannot match our standards, he will be found guilty.

ALFRED
I mean to try, Mr Carson.

MR CARSON
As long as you do. Right, go upstairs and get settled in. Your aunt will hopefully find you a livery that fits.

[O'Brien nods and Alfred follows her out.]

--
[00:07:52, EXT. DOWNTON GROUNDS - DAY]
[Mary and Matthew go on a walk together.]

MARY
Just at the start, so we've a place to sleep after the honeymoon. You can't object to that.

MATTHEW
No, it's nice of them. Though I doubt I'll get used to taking you to bed with your father watching.

MARY
(chuckle) He's so relieved we're getting married, he wouldn't mind if you carried me up naked.

MATTHEW (chuckle)
Careful, I might try it.

[They chuckle.]

MATTHEW
I don't want to move to London or anything. I'm not kicking against the traces.

MARY
Just testing their strength.

MATTHEW
I want us to get to know each other..to learn about who we both are without everybody being there.

MARY
Well, it's quite a big house.

MATTHEW
It's a lovely house. It's your home, and I want it to be my home, too. Just not quite yet.

[Mary looks at him and then nods.]

--
[00:08:39, EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY]
[Robert exits the station and walks up to a cab. A paper boy is selling papers that read "Bolshevik Menace."]

PAPERBOY
Paper! Russia [?]!

ROBERT
Chancery Lane.

CAB DRIVER
Yes, sir.

[Robert gets in the cab and it takes off.]

--
[00:08:52, INT. MR MURRAY'S OFFICE - DAY]

MR MURRAY
I have spoken to Frobisher and Currant and since I am a trustee, should the estate ever need one, we felt I ought to be the one to tell you.

ROBERT
You make it sound very serious.

MR MURRAY
I am expressing myself badly if you think it is not serious.

ROBERT
Why did we invest so much.

MR MURRAY
Lord Grantham, it was you who insisted we should. If you remember, we advised against it.

ROBERT
But war would mean a huge expansion of railways everywhere. Every forecast was certain. Rail shares were bound to make a fortune.

MR MURRAY
Many did, but your principle holding, which was very large, indeed, was in the Canadian Grand Trunk line.

[Robert stands up, getting upset.]

ROBERT
It was the main railway in British North America, for god's sake! It wasn't just me. Everyone said we couldn't lose! We knew hard times were coming for estates like Downton, and this investment would make it safe for the rest of time.

MR MURRAY
Charles Hayes was the presiding genius, and since he died, the management has not...the fact is, the company is about to be declared bankrupt...

[Robert leans forward on the chairback.]

MR MURRAY
And the line will be absorbed into the Canadian National Railway scheme.

[Robert leans harder into the chairback as the news sinks in.]

ROBERT
Are you really telling me that all the money is gone?

MR MURRAY
I'm afraid so.

ROBERT
The lion's share of Cora's fortune.

[Murray responds only with a look and Robert turns away to process the blow as Murray observes him.]

ROBERT
I won't give in, Murray. I've sacrificed too much to Downton to give in now. I refuse to be the failure, the earl who dropped the torch and let the flame go out.

MR MURRAY
I...hate to state the obvious, but if there's not enough money to run it, Downton must go. Unless you break it up and sell it off piecemeal.

ROBERT
I couldn't do that. I have a duty beyond saving my own skin. The estate must be a major employer and support the house, or there's no point to it. To any of it.

--
ACT TWO
[00:10:57, EXT. DOWNTON VILLAGE - DAY]
[Workers drape strings of white flags across the street and houses.]

WORKER
Morning.

[A worker tips his hat to a woman passing by. A car drives down the street, passing the post office.]

SIR ANTHONY STRALLAN
Lady Edith!

[The car slows to a stop and Edith approaches with a smile.]

EDITH
Hello!

STRALLAN
Hello!

EDITH
What are you doing here?

STRALLAN
I'm meeting a train, but I'm too early.

EDITH
Oh.

[Edith opens the car door and steps in. Strallan is surprised.]

STRALLAN
Oh, I mustn't hold you up.

EDITH
Oh, I'm not doing anything.

STRALLAN
Oh.

EDITH
I thought I'd get away from wedding panic.

[They chuckle.]

STRALLAN
Don't you like weddings.

EDITH
Oh, don't be silly. Of course I do. Only, I've talked of clothes and flowers, and food and guests until I'm blue in the face.

[They chuckle.]

STRALLAN
Yes, weddings can be reminders of one's loneliness, can't they? Sorry, I don't know why I said that. So, how's it going? Is your grandmother coming over from New York for it?

EDITH
She is.

[Chuckle.]

STRALLAN
And Sybil, is she here yet?

EDITH
As a matter of fact, she wasn't coming, but I think she is now. Mary had a letter this morning. Papa doesn't know yet.

STRALLAN
He will be pleased.

EDITH
I do hope so.

--
[00:11:58, INT. CRAWLEY HOUSE, MATTHEW'S DRESSING ROOM - EVENING]

MR MOLESLEY
So, you'll live at the big house when you're back from honeymoon?

MATTHEW
Not live. Stay. We'll stay there until we decide where to go. It'll be on the estate, I should think, or in the village.

MR MOLESLEY
Not here?

MATTHEW
No. I shall expect you and Mrs Bird to look after Mrs Crawley.

[Molesley looks up in surprise.]

MR MOLESLEY
Y--you'll not be taking me with you, sir? Only, I thought you'd be needing...a proper valet once you're married.

MATTHEW
I've always thought of you as more of a butler who helps out as a valet and not the other way around.

MR MOLESLEY
Oh, I'd be happy to be a valet, sir, especially in the big house.

MATTHEW
We won't be in the big house for long. To be honest, Molesley, I want to live more simply after the wedding.

[Molesley is clearly disappointed.]

MATTHEW
And besides, Mother absolutely relies on you.

MR MOLESLEY
Well, that's very nice to hear, sir. Thank you.

--
[00:12:52, INT. LORD GRANTHAM'S DRESSING ROOM - EVENING]
[Thomas helps Robert dress for dinner.]

THOMAS
You must be exhausted, milord. You can't have spent more than two hours in London.

ROBERT
It was sufficient.

THOMAS
The new footman arrived while you were gone.

[Robert starts.]

ROBERT
What?

THOMAS
Yes. He got the cable this morning and came straight over. Very eager. And very tall.

ROBERT
But when did--? Never mind.

--
[00:13:17, INT. GREAT HALL - EVENING]
[Robert catches up to Cora on the staircase.]

ROBERT
Did you know about the new footman?

CORA
Of course. He's already here.

ROBERT
Why did no one tell me?

CORA
What do you mean? We talked about it last night...in my room.

ROBERT
Well, nobody else must be taken on. Absolutely no one...until things are settled.

CORA
What things?

[Robert hesitates.]

ROBERT
How's the wedding going? I suppose it's costing the earth.

CORA
Mary was never gonna marry on the cheap.

ROBERT
Oh, no. Nothing must be done on the cheap.

[Cora stares after Robert as he leaves.]

--
[00:13:46, INT. SERVANTS' CORRIDOR - EVENING]
[O'Brien checks her nephew's livery.]

ALFRED
I feel quite nervous.

O'BRIEN
Don't be. You've got the skill, and you've got the willingness.

[Thomas passes by.]

THOMAS
But he hasn't got the experience.

ALFRED
He's right.

O'BRIEN
Pay no attention. (towards Thomas) You've a nice manner, Alfred. You're not vain like Thomas. (to Alfred) They'll like that.

--
[00:14:01, INT. KITCHEN - EVENING]
[Daisy works with rough, angry motions.]

THOMAS
What's the matter with you?

DAISY
I'm fed up. They promised me promotion. She said they'd get a new kitchen maid and I'd be Mrs Patmore's assistant.

THOMAS
Well, if they really promised, you should withdraw your services.

DAISY
What do you mean? Like go on strike?

THOMAS
But don't say I put you up to it.

[Daisy considers his suggestion hesitantly.]

--
[00:14:21, INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING]

VIOLET
But what was in the letter?

MARY
Just that Sybil's coming after all. She'll be here on Wednesday in time for dinner.

[Matthew smiles.]

ISOBEL
Will she be coming alone?

MATTHEW
Don't make trouble, Mother.

[Isobel gives Matthew a wide-eyed look. Alfred begins serving Violet's dinner himself.]

VIOLET
Can I do it?

ALFRED
If you wish, my lady, of course.

[Alfred puts the serving utensils in the dish so Violet can serve herself.]

VIOLET
Are--Are you really that tall?

ALFRED
Yes, my lady.

VIOLET
I thought you might have been walking on stilts.

[Edith chuckles.]

MARY
When does Grandmamma arrive?

CORA
She gets into Liverpool on the fifteenth, so she'll be here the day before the wedding.

VIOLET
I'm so looking forward to seeing your mother again. When I'm with her, I'm reminded of the virtues of the English.

MATTHEW
Isn't she American?

VIOLET
Exactly.

[Matthew gives a sidelong look at Violet's insult.]

ROBERT
Can I...help myself?

[Alfred stops trying to dish out Robert's dinner.]

ALFRED
Oh, you want to as well, my lord?

[Alfred puts down the serving utensils.]

ROBERT
To be honest, I think you'll find that we all want to do it as well.

MR CARSON (harsh whisper)
What do you think you're doing? You're not in a hotel now.

ISOBEL
Did you train in a hotel?

ALFRED
I did, ma'am.

[Alfred is about to pick up the utensils, then leaves them and lets Isobel serve herself. Carson glares at Alfred.]

ISOBEL
That will be useful, won't it, Carson?

[Carson avoids her look.]

ISOBEL
Are you all set for the wedding?

[Carson gives a smile.]

MARY
Of course he is. Carson's motto is "Be prepared."

VIOLET
I'm afraid Baden-Powell has stolen it.

CORA
But you have all the help you need?

MR CARSON
Well, I wouldn't fight the idea of a second footman, my lady.

MATTHEW
I don't know about the rest of you, but I sometimes think it's time we lived in a simpler way.

ISOBEL
I agree. Much cattle, much care.

ROBERT
Always supposing we have the choice.

VIOLET
Oh, don't say that. It's our job to provide employment. An aristocrat with no servants is as much use to the county as a glass hammer.

[Violet and Edith chuckle.]

--
[00:15:58, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - EVENING]
[Anna and O'Brien are already seated when Thomas and Molesley enter.]

THOMAS
I knew this would happen. Typical.

O'BRIEN
What's typical?

THOMAS
That I'd wind up looking after Mr Matthews. That's all I need.

MR MOLESLEY
He hasn't thought it through. I'm sorry to say, but he hasn't.

ANNA
Are you worried for your job, Mr Molesley?

MR MOLESLEY
Me? Oh, heavens, no. No, no, no, I'm essential to Mrs Crawley. She relies on me. That's what he said. "Essential."

[The servants are irked by his pompous attitude.]

O'BRIEN
Oh, yes. We're all essential. Until we get sacked.

[Carson enters and the servants stand.]

O'BRIEN
How was it?

MR CARSON
Alfred was confused. He thought he'd been transported to the Hotel Metropole.

ANNA
Cheer up. You'll get the hang of it.

ALFRED
Will I?

[The servants sit. Mrs Hughes enters and gives Molesley a friendly greeting.]

MRS HUGHES
Oh, you're still here Mr Molesley.

MR MOLESLEY
I know. I only walked over for a cup of tea and a chat. But I've outstayed my welcome.

MRS HUGHES
Nonsense. Why not have a bite with us? They won't be leaving for a half hour or more.

MR MOLESLEY
No, I better get back. I wouldn't want them to get home and me not be there to let them in.

[O'Brien makes fun of him.]

O'BRIEN
No, you wouldn't. Not when you're essential.

--
[00:16:58, INT. GREAT HALL - EVENING]
[The family withdraws for the evening.]

MARY
Then why is he coming all the way here? Why not say it on the telephone?

MATTHEW
I have no idea.

MARY
If Mr Swire's lawyer wants to see you and it's urgent, it means he's left you something.

MATTHEW
I doubt it. I would have heard long before this. Anyway, I hope not.

MARY
Why?

[Matthew gives Mary a look.]

ISOBEL
Matthew! Do come on!

[Isobel wraps herself tightly in her coat.]

ISOBEL
The chauffeur's freezing to death and so am I.

[Matthew looks back to Mary.]

MATTHEW
Are you looking forward to the wedding?

[Mary smiles.]

MARY
What do you think?

[Matthew smirks.]

MATTHEW
I'm looking forward to all sorts of things.

[Mary smirks back as Matthew leans in.]

MARY
Don't make me blush.

ISOBEL
Matthew!

[Matthew looks back at Isobel, then kisses Mary on the cheek and leaves.]

--
[00:17:39, EXT. DOWNTON VILLAGE - DAY]
[A car drives through the village.]

--
[00:17:46, EXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY]
[The car approaches the house and the family and some servants wait to greet Branson and Sybil. Alfred opens the door for them and Branson hands Sybil down, his luggage in the other hand. Sybil steps out with a smile and goes straight to her father.]

SYBIL BRANSON
Dearest Papa.

[Sybil kisses his cheek.]

SYBIL
Tell me, did you send the money? Please say yes.

ROBERT (confused)
What money?

CORA (smiles)
Hello...Tom.

[Welcome to Downton. Cora approaches Tom with a bright smile and a handshake.]

TOM BRANSON
I hope I am welcome, Your Ladyship.

MARY
Of course.

[Tom gives a formal nod to Robert, who doesn't respond.]

MARY
Alfred, would you take the luggage for Mr Branson.

EDITH
There's tea in the library.

TOM
Thank you.

[Tom hands his luggage to Alfred. Sybil and Cora greet each other warmly as they head into the house and Tom smiles after them. He stops when he sees Carson.]

TOM (nods)
Hello, Mr Carson.

[Carson gives Tom a formal nod and Tom walks into the house.]

--
[00:18:46, INT. CRAWLEY HOUSE - DAY]
[A business man walks out of Crawley House.]

ISOBEL
Was that Mr Charkham I saw leaving?

[Isobel closes the door.]

MATTHEW
Yes, he said to make his apologies. He was late for his train.

ISOBEL
What did he have to say for himself?

MATTHEW
I don't know where to start. Basically, it seems that Reggie Swire did not wish to divide his fortune. So, when Lavinia died, he made a new will with a list of three possible heir, of which I was the third.

ISOBEL
Why didn't the first name succeed?

MATTHEW
He died before Reggie...in the same epidemic that killed Lavinia. But at first, they thought that the second heir, a Mr Clive Pulbrook would be easy to trace.

ISOBEL
How much money are we talking about?

MATTHEW
A lot. A huge amount. I had no idea. You could never have told it from Reggie's way of life.

ISOBEL
Lucky Mr Pulbrook.

MATTHEW
Well, this is it...Sometime before Reggie's death, Pulbrook travelled to the east, to India, to some tea plantations he owned there.

ISOBEL
And?

MATTHEW
He's never been heard of since. They've made inquiries. They've sent an agent out to visit his property. There's no sign of him.

--
[00:20:01, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - EVENING]
[Thomas looks through stiff collars at the table.]

THOMAS
I'm sorry, I won't. And that's flat.

MRS HUGHES
Then you'll have to do it, Mr Carson.

MR CARSON (indignant)
I'm not dressing a chauffeur.

MRS HUGHES
He is not a chauffeur now. Anyway, you don't have to dress him. Just see he's got everything he needs.

MR CARSON
I'm not often as one with Mr Barrow, but...no.

MRS HUGHES
Then Alfred must do it.

MR CARSON (scoffs)
Alfred. He wouldn't' know what to do beyond collecting dirty shoes outside the door.

[Thomas smirks.]

MRS HUGHES
Well, he'll have to learn.

[Mrs Hughes looks disapprovingly at Thomas and Carson before she leaves. Carson gives a surprised look to Thomas. Thomas shrugs his shoulders.]

--
[00:20:32, INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING]

VIOLET
Is it an Irish tradition?

TOM
What?

ROBERT
She means not changing.

[Tom looks down at his plain clothes.]

SYBIL (irked)
Of course not, Granny.

VIOLET
It might have been. You don't change on the first night of a voyage.

[Mary isn't pleased by the conversation either.]

TOM
No, my lady. I don't own a set of tails. Or a dinner jacket either. I wouldn't get any use out of them.

ROBERT
Well, I hope you own a morning coat since you're here for a wedding.

TOM
No, I'm afraid I don't.

SYBIL
We live a completely different kind of life, Papa.

ROBERT
Obviously.

[Carson holds the serving dish at Tom's eye level.]

TOM
Could you lower it a bit, please, Mr Carson.

[Carson obliges.]

MARY
You should buy a Downton wardrobe and leave it here. Then you won't have to pack when you come.

EDITH
What a good idea.

[Sybil smiles at their suggestion.]

TOM
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't turn into somebody else just to please you.

VIOLET
More's the pity.

ISOBEL
Oh, now why should you change to please us?

MATTHEW
What is the general feeling in Ireland now?

TOM
That we're in sight of throwing off the English yoke.

ISOBEL
Do you approve of the new act?

TOM
Would you approve if your country'd been divided by a foreign power?

ISOBEL
Well, won't it bring home rule for Southern Ireland nearer?

TOM
Home rule on English terms, presided over by an English king.

MATTHEW
Is keeping the monarchy a problem?

TOM
Would it be a problem for you to be ruled by the German Kaiser?

[Carson snaps a glass stem in his shock. Robert turns to look.]

ROBERT
Carson, are you all right?

MR CARSON
I've been very clumsy, my lord. I do apologise.

[Sybil closes her eyes in embarrassment. Cora attempts to redirect the conversation to safer topics.]

CORA
Is it true that Irish gardens have more variety than ours.

[The attempt was so obvious that Robert sighs.]

EDITH
Oh, yes. Don't you remember Lady Dufferin's ball at Clandeboye? The gardens there were heavenly.

[No one's fooled by the topic change and the Bransons both look uncomfortable.]

--
[00:21:58, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - EVENING]
[The servants sit down to dinner.]

ALFRED
I thought them very down on him.

THOMAS
That is because you know nothing.

MR CARSON
And wasn't he down on them - insulting our country, insulting the king? I thought it was a miracle His Lordship held his temper.

MRS HUGHES
But it must be hard, Mr Carson, to sit up there with people he used to drive around.

TOM
It is hard, Mrs Hughes.

[Tom stands in the doorway. Carson bolts up from his chair and the other servants follow suit.]

TOM (hurriedly)
Please, sit down.

[Mrs Hughes debates, but Mr Carson remains resolutely standing and the other servants remain standing.]

MR CARSON (stiffly)
Is there something we can do, sir?

TOM
I just wanted to come down to say hello. I wouldn't want you to think I got too big for my boots.

MRS HUGHES (smiles)
That's nice.

[Tom and Mrs Hughes's smiles are swallowed in Carson's presence.]

ANNA
I hope you and Lady Sybil are well.

TOM
We are, thank you. And we've been following the story of Mr Bates. Mary keeps us informed.

[Mrs Hughes and Anna smile, but Carson stiffens further at Tom's informality.]

TOM
Still, I mustn't interrupt your dinner.

[Tom begins to leave in the silence. Mrs Hughes offers an olive branch.]

MRS HUGHES
Thank you for coming down.

[Mrs Hughes and Tom share a friendly smile, and Carson exchanges disapproving looks as Tom leaves. The servants sit back down.]

O'BRIEN
He's settled into his new life.

MR CARSON
"Mary keeps us informed"?

MRS HUGHES
Well, he knows her now.

MR CARSON
What's that got to do with it? His Lordship would never call her Mary when talking to me. Never. If he wants to play their game, he better learn their rules.

[Mrs Hughes shoots Carson another disapproving look.]

--
[00:23:11, INT. DRAWING ROOM - EVENING]
[Some of the ladies play cards while Robert and Mary get drinks.]

VIOLET
Tomorrow, let's ask the servants to come up and dine with us. It'll make things easier. (chuckle)

MARY
You must get him to stop calling Granny "milady." And Mama.

ISOBEL
We need something that doesn't sound too stiff and grand.

ROBERT
Lady Grantham, of course. And he can call me Lord Grantham.

SYBIL
That doesn't sound stiff or grand at all.

[Mary catches Sybil's look.]

MARY (softly)
One step at a time.

[Sybil smiles. Mary walks to Matthew who's on the sofa.]

MARY
So, what did the lawyer want? I presume he turned up.

MATTHEW
He did...and it's rather complicated. But you were right, it was about Reggie's will.

MARY
So, he's left you something?

MATTHEW
Never mind that now. Just sit down and tell me about the relations that are coming for the wedding. I want to unscramble them in my head.

--
[00:23:58, INT. KITCHEN - EVENING]
[Daisy is cleaning up the kitchen as Mrs Patmore takes off her apron.]

MRS PATMORE
Go to bed when you're done.

DAISY
I'll go to bed when I'm ready.

[Mrs Patmore looks up.]

MRS PATMORE
What's happened to you? Have you swapped places with your evil twin?

DAISY
I'd like to know where the new kitchen maid is. That's what you promised. They've got a new footman, where's the kitchen maid?

MRS PATMORE
I know and I'm sorry, but I spoke to Mr Carson tonight and they won't be taking anyone new on.

DAISY
Except a footman.

MRS PATMORE
I don't know how Mr Carson managed it, because His Lordship's put his foot down. But you're called my assistant now, and you've seven shillings extra every month.

DAISY
You've still kept me here with a dishonest representation.

MRS PATMORE
Oh, dear! Have you swallowed a dictionary?

[Mrs Patmore walks out in a huff.]

--
[00:24:36, INT. DRAWING ROOM - EVENING]
[Sybil and Mary are the only ones left in the room.]

SYBIL
Somehow none of it seems to matter when we're in Dublin. Class and all that just seems to fade away. I'm Mrs Branson and we get on with our lives like millions of others.

[Mary nods in understanding.]

SYBIL
But here, he feels so patronised, and he hates it.

MARY
But you don't regret it?

SYBIL
No, never.

[They both smile.]

SYBIL
He's a wonderful, wonderful man.

[Mary gives Sybil an affectionate touch.]

SYBIL
I just wish you knew him.

MARY
Darling, we will know him. We'll know him and value him. I promise.

SYBIL (smiles)
Anyway...I best go upstairs

[They rise from the couch.]

SYBIL
Make sure he's not too suicidal. Goodnight.

[They kiss goodnight.]

MARY
Oh, by the way, I don't know if Mama's told you, but the whole Grey family's coming tomorrow night.

[Mary's mouth twitches. Sybil exhales in amusement.]

SYBIL
Including Larry?

[Mary nods with an amused smile.]

SYBIL
Crikey.

[Sybil laughs.]

MARY
You'd better warn Tom.

[Sybil turns to go.]

MARY
Oh, and Sybil, if I were you, I wouldn't tell Papa about being Mrs Branson.

[They chuckle slightly and Sybil agrees with a shake of her head. She leaves and Mary takes a sip of tea.]

--
[00:25:39, INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT]

TOM
But who are the Greys? And why does it matter that they're coming?

[Sybil takes off her robe.]

SYBIL
The father, Lord Merton, is Mary's godfather, but Larry Grey used to be keen on me when we were young.

TOM
Were you keen on him.

SYBIL
No, I don't think so. I can hardly remember, to be honest.

[Sybil gets into bed and Tom puts his arm around her.]

TOM
So, what are you saying?

SYBIL
Well, nothing, particularly. But we could run into Ripon and find some tails. We have the money.

TOM
I won't spend more of that money.

SYBIL
All right.

[Sybil takes Tom's hand and he looks at it.]

SYBIL
Please don't talk about Ireland all the time.

[He looks at her.]

SYBIL
I just want to make things easier for you.

TOM
For me or for you? Don't disappoint me, Sybil. Not now that we're here.

[They regard each other for a moment, and then he leans down and they kiss. He kisses her forehead and they cuddle.]

--
[00:26:34, INT. DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT]
[Matthew and Mary linger.]

MARY
Shall I order the car?

MATTHEW
I don't think I can refuse a lift with Mother and then make the poor man go out again.

[Matthew sits down.]

MATTHEW
I'll walk.

MARY
It might rain.

MATTHEW
Then I'll get wet.

[Mary chuckles and they smile at one another from across the room. Matthew holds out his hand to her.]

MATTHEW
Now come and kiss me.

[Mary takes a couple of steps towards him, then stops and folds her hands in front of her.]

MARY
So, if they can't find Mr...Pillbox...

[Matthew drops his hand and closes his eyes with a smile and a turn of his head.]

MARY
What will you do with the money?

MATTHEW
Pulbrook, and...they will find him.

[Mary nods.]

MARY
But if they don't.

MATTHEW
Then...I'll decide what to do. Or we will.

[Mary nods. Matthew thinks about it.]

MATTHEW
Because I can't keep it.

MARY
No. Of course not.

[Matthew takes a casual sip of his drink and Mary stands there, somewhat stiffly.]

--
[00:27:18, INT. CORA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT]
[Cora and Robert sit across from each other in their dressing gowns.]

CORA
Why were you so heavily invested in one enterprise? Wasn't it foolish? Has some of my fortune been lost?

ROBERT
Some...?

[Robert shakes his head.]

ROBERT
All. Or almost all.

[Cora looks at Robert with pitying shock. Robert begins to cry. He leans forward on his hands and elbows.]

CORA (whisper)
Oh, my dear.

[Cora watches him cry with pity and then crouches to her knees to comfort him.]

CORA (whisper)
How terrible for you.

ROBERT
It's not so good for you.

[Cora laughs.]

CORA
Don't worry about me, I'm an American. I have gun, will travel.

[Robert looks at her with encouragement.]

ROBERT
Oh, thank God for you.

[Robert kisses her hand.]

ROBERT
Anyway.

[He kisses her hand again, giving in to a few more tears before looking up.]

CORA
You know what?

[Cora looks up at him with a smile.]

CORA
I'm glad we have a wedding to celebrate. Let's make sure it's a great day. If it's to be our last, let's make it a wonderful last. And enjoy our lovely home and the lovely people we spend our life among.

[Cora and Robert embrace.]

--
[00:28:37, INT. DOWNTON VILLAGE - DAY]
[Tom walks toward the Grantham Arms and Matthew sees him in the street.]

MATTHEW
A bit early for drowning your sorrows.

TOM
I thought it might be better if I moved down to the pub.

MATTHEW
You're not serious?

TOM
I can't go through too many more dinners like last night.

MATTHEW
You don't make it easy for them. You really think you can recruit Cousin Robert for Sinn Féin?

[Tom chuckles with a shake of his head.]

TOM
I don't know what gets into me. I can see them staring and I know they don't want me here.

MATTHEW
Well, don't include me. Or Mary.

TOM
She wasn't too keen on the idea of a chauffeur for a brother-in-law.

MATTHEW
Forget that, she's a...pragmatist.

[Matthew rolls his eyes.]

TOM (nods)
She could be a tough fighter, too.

MATTHEW
Well, let's hope she's not tested. Now, forget this, and walk back. We're brothers-in-law with high-minded wives. We better stick together.

[Tom grins as they walk off together.]

--
[00:29:21, INT. PRISON - DAY]
[A guard escorts Bates to his meeting with Anna.]

--
[Bates hands Anna a letter.]

BATES
It's all there. Friends - though there weren't too many - tradesmen, acquaintances. But I can't see what you'll get out of them.

ANNA
I do not believe, when Vera decided to kill herself, she never mentioned it to another living soul.

BATES
We know she left no note. I wish to God she had. But why are you sure it was suicide and not murder?

ANNA
Well, I know you didn't kill her. Then what's the alternative? A thief broke in, cooked an arsenic pie and forced her to eat it? It's not a very likely scenario.

BATES
You can see why they convicted me.

ANNA
I'm going to write to everyone in the book, in case she said or, please God, wrote anything that could suggest a desire to die.

BATES
But how long will it take?

ANNA
Why? Are you going somewhere?

[Anna gives Bates a small, playful smile. He smiles back.]

--
[30:20, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - EVENING]

ALFRED
Should have gone into cooking. I used to watch them in the kitchens and I could pick it up in a [?].

DAISY
Why didn't you then?

O'BRIEN
Oh, it's a hard ladder for a man. For every Escoffier monsieur [?], there's a thousand dogsbodies taking orders from a cross and red faced old woman.

[Alfred chuckles. Mrs Patmore appears behind them.]

MRS PATMORE
Er, who's this you're discussing?

O'BRIEN
Hello, Mrs Patmore. I didn't see you standing there.

MRS PATMORE
Obviously not.

[Alfred smiles in amusement. Daisy and Mrs Patmore clear away the dishes from the table.]

ALFRED
Mum and Aunt Sarah thought I'd be better off as a butler? And so that's what I'm trying for.

DAISY
I think you're right. I know I'd rather be giving the orders.

[Daisy walks off with the tray.]

MRS PATMORE
To a cross and red faced old woman. Yes, we know.

[Mrs Patmore follows her out with another tray. Alfred pours O'Brien another cup of tea and she smiles at him.]

--
[00:30:55, INT. LADY EDITH'S BEDROOM - EVENING]
[Anna finishes Edith's hair.]

ANNA
There. Is that what you meant?

EDITH
Yes. Perfect. Slightly new, but not too different. We'll see if Sir Anthony notices.

[Anna chuckles with a smile.]

EDITH
I know they all think he's too old for me, but he's not. Bates is older than you and you are as happy as lovebirds.

ANNA
Our situation is hardly ideal, but... Yes. We're very happy together.

EDITH
Which is all that matters.

[Edith checks her appearance in the mirror.]

EDITH
As I keep telling them.

--
[00:31:30, INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - EVENING]
[Thomas walks past O'Brien .]

THOMAS
I've no time to talk.

O'BRIEN
His Lordship's not come up yet.

[Thomas stops and turns to face her.]

THOMAS
Well? What is it?

O'BRIEN
I was hoping you could help young Alfred to find his way about.

THOMAS
As a footman, you mean?

O'BRIEN
As a valet.

[Thomas raises his eyebrows and turns away. O'Brien follows.]

O'BRIEN
He's looking after Mr Branson now. Though, I daresay, a chauffeur can dress himself.

[Thomas stops to listen.]

O'BRIEN
But you could tell him what he needs to know, give him an advantage.

THOMAS
Why? What's the rush?

O'BRIEN
You've heard Mr Matthew has turned down Mr Molesley.

THOMAS
Blimey, you don't want much, do you? Can you remember what I had to go through to be a valet?

O'BRIEN (chuckles)
Of course, I watched it, didn't I?

THOMAS
But young Alfred is to make the great leap in one bound? Well, I'm sorry, Miss O'Brien, but I'm not convinced, if you'll excuse me.

[O'Brien is unhappy with his response as he enters Robert's dressing room.]

--
ACT THREE
[00:32:26, EXT. FRONT DOOR - EVENING]
[The guests arrive in motor cars.]

--
[00:32:43, INT. DRAWING ROOM - EVENING]

MATTHEW
It's infuriating. There's nothing he can do.

MARY
I don't agree. I think it's feeble. He should will himself not to be ill and then collapse the next day.

[Matthew sighs and gives Mary an amused look at her unreasonableness. She smiles at her own humour.]

MARY
Whom will you ask instead?

MATTHEW
I'm not sure.

[Larry Grey speaks with Tom Branson in another part of the room.]

LARRY GREY
I've known Sybil all my life. So you can imagine how curious I was when I found out you'd be here tonight. I never thought we'd meet in person.

TOM
As opposed to what? In spirit?

[Larry considers the comment, then straightens up pompously.]

LARRY GREY
Well, you see, to us, in marrying you, it seemed like Sybil had left Downton Abbey forever. If you...know what I mean.

[Larry gives an arrogant chuckle.]

TOM
I know exactly what you mean.

[Larry nods.]

LARRY GREY
Did they lose your suitcase on the way over? How maddening for you.

TOM
No, my suitcase arrived safely, thank you.

[Tom puts down his drink.]

TOM
Along with my manners.

[Tom walks away angrily. Violet sees him as she and Isobel enter.]

VIOLET
He's still dressed as the man from the prudential, I see.

[Violet takes a deep breath.]

ISOBEL
Yes, it's nice to have someone from the real world, isn't it?

[Isobel walks off and Violet purses her lips. Robert walks over to her.]

ROBERT
Hello, Mamma. Can I tempt you to one of these new cocktails?

VIOLET
No, no, I don't think so. They look too exciting for so early in the evening, don't you think so, Carson?

MR CARSON
Better avoided, my lady.

VIOLET
I don't think so.

[Violet waves away the tray of drinks. Edith joins Isobel and Sir Anthony in another part of the room.]

ISOBEL
What a pleasure it is to see you out and about, Sir Anthony.

SIR ANTHONY
I want to say, "Can I be of any help?" but you don't seem to need any.

EDITH
He doesn't need help at all, do you? He won't let me do anything.

SIR ANTHONY
Mustn't be a nuisance, you know?

ISOBEL
Are you coming to the wedding?

[Sir Anthony opens his mouth to answer, but Edith answers immediately.]

EDITH
Of course.

SIR ANTHONY
Well...if you really want me.

EDITH
I do. I really do.

[Edith smiles at him and he smiles back.]

SIR ANTHONY
You look very nice. Have you done something jolly with your hair?

[Edith's mouth opens in pleased surprise. Sir Anthony sees something behind her.]

SIR ANTHONY
I say, what the devil?

EDITH
What is it?

[Edith and Isobel turn to see Larry turning away from a small table.]

MR CARSON
Dinner is served, Your Ladyship.

--
[00:34:37, INT. KITCHENS - EVENING]
[Alfred enters shaking his head.]

DAISY
How's it going?

ALFRED
Awkward. Mr Branson's well aware Lady Sybil doesn't like it much.

[Alfred picks up the next dinner tray.]

ALFRED
I don't understand it. He's only had one cocktail.

DAISY
Maybe he was drinking before he came down to calm his nerves.

[Alfred sighs with a shake of his head and exits with the tray. Daisy and Mrs Patmore make significant looks.]

--
[00:34:53, INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING]

TOM
No, I don't agree! And I don't care who knows it!

[Sybil puts down her silverware, upset by Tom's behaviour.]

TOM
Or that the Black and Tans are there to restore order, are they? Well, why don't they just murder the entire population, and then you wouldn't hear a squeak out of any of them!?

[Mary is also tense from Tom's awkward shouting.]

VIOLET
Is there any way to shut him up?

ROBERT
If I knew how to control him, he wouldn't be here in the first place.

CORA
Are you interested in Irish politics, Lord Merton?

LORD MERTON
Well, I was only just saying that I thought--

TOM
He's interested in Irish repression! Like all of you.

[Larry smiles, trying to hold in his laughter.]

MATTHEW
Look, old chap, of course this stuff matters a great deal to you.

TOM
Yes, it does matter. This stuff.

[Mary looks over and sees Larry holding in another smile.]

TOM
It matters a very great deal.

MARY
What's so funny?

LARRY GREY
Nothing, I'm just enjoying this vivid display of Irish character.

[Sir Anthony looks at Larry sharply.]

SYBIL
Please, Tom, we don't need to wear everyone out.

TOM
Why? What's the matter? Am I not being polite enough?

[Tom tosses his napkin on the table.]

SIR ANTHONY
Well, wait a minute. This was down to you, wasn't it?

[Larry furrows his eyebrows in confusion.]

LARRY GREY
I don't know what you mean.

SIR ANTHONY
Yes, you do. I saw you. You put something in his drink, didn't you? Just before we came in.

[Everyone looks at Larry.]

SYBIL
That's not true, is it, Larry?

EDITH
What a beastly thing to do.

LARRY GREY
Oh, come on, Edith. That's not like you. You could always take a joke.

[Edith stares in surprise.]

MARY
A bully's defence.

[Larry turns to Mary and his smile drops.]

MARY
Listen everyone, Mr Grey has given my brother-in-law something to make him appear drunk.

VIOLET
Could it be drink?

MARY
No, not drink. Some horrible pill. Sybil, take him upstairs.

ROBERT
Il ne manque ça.

[Sybil and Isobel fuss over helping Tom.]

CORA
Tom has been the victim of a cruel prank, which I know you will all be kind enough to forget.

VIOLET
Forgive, perhaps. Forget, never.

LORD MERTON
Is this true, Larry?

LARRY GREY
I don't know why you're getting so hot under the collar. He's only a grubby little chauffeur chap--

[Lord Merton, Matthew, and Robert all bolt out of their chairs in indignation.]

LORD MERTON
Be silent this instant, sir!

[Larry stares wide-eyed at his father. Lord Merton turns calmly to Tom, who's slightly hunched over on the serving table with Sybil's support.]

LORD MERTON
I apologize for my son, Mr Branson. Unreservedly. I only hope you'll recover before the wedding.

[Tom nods.]

MATTHEW
I hope so, too.

[Matthew steps over to Tom.]

MATTHEW
Since I want him to be my best man.

[Matthew claps Tom on the shoulder. Robert looks at Matthew in surprise as he's about to sit down, and Carson and Isobel's jaws drop. Isobel shortly recovers.]

ISOBEL
Bravo! Well said!

[Tom stares at Matthew and Sybil smiles.]

SYBIL
Do you really mean it?

[Tom stares at Matthew with bright hopefulness in his eyes.]

TOM
Honestly?

MATTHEW
I've told you before, if we're mad enough to take on the Crawley girls, we have to stick together.

[Mary beams happily.]

MARY
Oh! Thank you, Matthew. Thank you so much.

[Matthew smiles and Tom pats him on the arm as he hunches toward the door.]

--
[00:36:59, EXT. FRONT DOOR - EVENING]

EDITH
That was rather marvellous of you...to expose Larry Grey like that. You saved the day, really.

SIR ANTHONY
Oh, I wouldn't say that. Matthew saved the day.

EDITH
No, it was you.

[Sir Anthony smiles modestly.]

EDITH
I do hope we'll be seeing a bit more of you once the wedding's over.

SIR ANTHONY
Well, er...

EDITH
Wouldn't you like that?

SIR ANTHONY
Oh, I should like that very much. Much more than I probably ought to.

[Edith smiles.]

ROBERT
Edith, let Sir Anthony go.

[Robert calls to her from the doorway as another pair of guests leave. Sir Anthony turns around to look at Robert. Edith takes the opportunity to lean in and kiss his cheek. He smiles a bit, then puts on his hat and watches at her as she returns to the house.]

EDITH
Goodnight, Papa.

[Sir Anthony's car drives away and Robert enters the house.]

--
[00:37:39, INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT]

ROBERT
Well, that's the last of them. Where are the others?

CORA
They've gone to bed.

ROBERT
So has Edith. And so should we.

[Robert goes for a nightcap.]

ROBERT
Golly. What a night for the county to feed off.

CORA
But it was good of Matthew to show solidarity.

ROBERT
I suppose so. We're going to need all the solidarity we can muster.

[Robert takes a sip.]

CORA
When will you tell the girls ?

ROBERT
I think I should tell Mary now.

CORA
No, not before the wedding, surely.

ROBERT
I must. They're disagreeing about where they should live, so it'd be wrong for me to keep it from them. Then they can discuss it on the honeymoon and decide more sensibly. Do you think we should say something to your mother when she gets here?

CORA
No. She'll go into state mourning and cast a pall over the whole proceedings.

ROBERT (chuckles)
Thank God she missed tonight's drama or we'd never hear the end of it.

CORA
Don't worry. She'll bring enough drama of her own.

[Cora chuckles.]

ROBERT
Mm.

[Robert takes a drink.]

--
[00:38:40, INT. PRISON, BATES'S CELL - NIGHT]
[Bates looks over the pages Anna gave him.]

CRAIG
Won't work, you know? And if you don't admit your guilt, they won't let you go when the time comes.

BATES
How can I admit what isn't true?

CRAIG
Why do you have to be so pious?

[Bates shifts his head, but doesn't respond.]

CRAIG
You're a touchy fellow, aren't you?

BATES
Don't push me, Craig.

CRAIG
Is that a warning?

BATES
Yes. Yes, it is.

[Bates glares over his shoulder.]

BATES
I'm warning you.

[Craig stares at Bates and Bates turns back to his desk.]

--
[00:39:21, INT. LADY MARY'S BEDROOM - DAY]
[Anna and the Crawley sisters look over Mary's new outfit.]

EDITH
I'm not sure about the hat. Is it supposed to look crooked?

SYBIL
Don't listen to her. I love it. You're not to change a thing.

MARY
Anna?

ANNA
I think you look lovely, milady.

[Mary smiles. There's a knock at the door and the ladies turn around.]

SYBIL
Stop. Wait. Who is it?

[The door stops opening.]

ROBERT
Your longsuffering papa.

MARY
I suppose he can come in.

[Robert enters and Mary holds out her hands for his opinion.]

ROBERT
What's this for?

MARY
Going away.

[Mary twists so he can see the back.]

MARY
How does it look?

ROBERT
Expensive.

[Edith smiles.]

MARY
Twice the national debt, I'm afraid.

[Robert chuckles.]

MARY
But I know you don't mind.

[Mary cringes hopefully/apologetically.]

ROBERT
Can I have one moment alone to give Mary my blessing?

SYBIL
That's lovely. Shoo, everyone.

[The other girls leave and Mary takes off her hat, then turns back to her father.]

MARY
Go on. Bless me.

[Mary raises her eyes to the heavens playfully.]

ROBERT
Of course.

[Robert steps forward.]

ROBERT
But there's something I feel I ought to tell you first. I wanted to wait until you got back, but I don't believe I can.

MARY
That sounds rather ominous.

--
[00:40:21, EXT. DOWNTON VILLAGE - DAY]
[Tom crosses the street.]

--
[00:40:26, INT. CRAWLEY HOUSE, FRONT HALL - DAY]
[Tom enters and takes off his hat.]

TOM
Hello, Mr Molesley. I got a message to call on Mrs Crawley.

MR MOLESLEY
Very good, sir.

[Molesley bows. Tom walks toward the living room, but Molesley speaks up.]

MR MOLESLEY
If you'd like to...

[Molesley nods to Tom's hat.]

MR MOLESLEY
...give me your hat and coat, sir.

--
[00:40:34, INT. CRAWLEY HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY]

VIOLET
Are you going up to the house...to welcome the Queen of Sheeba?

ISOBEL
Oh, I think so. Are you?

VIOLET
No. I'll pay homage at dinner.

ISOBEL
I've always admired the way Mrs Levinson is never overawed by the whole set up at Downton.

VIOLET
Was Napoleon overawed by the Bourbons?

[The door opens and Mr Molesley enters with Tom.]

VIOLET
Oh.

[They turn to face Tom.]

ISOBEL
Come in, Tom. May I call you Tom?

TOM
Of course. Good afternoon, milady. That is, Lady Grantham. I'm glad to find you here because...I want to apologize for last night.

[Violet holds out a hand with a shake of her head, dismissing his apoloogy.]

ISOBEL
Oh, there's no need. We know it was not your fault.

VIOLET
You weren't the first drunk in that dining room, I can assure you.

[Isobel chuckles and Tom smiles.]

TOM
Only the first republican.

VIOLET
Well, you've got me there.

TOM (to Isobel)
Why was it you wanted to see me?

ISOBEL
We've asked Molesley to look out Matthew's old morning coat. He's confident he can make it fit.

TOM
That's very kind, ladies, but you see, I don't approve of the costumes. I see them as the uniform of oppression, and I should be uncomfortable wearing them.

VIOLET
Are you quite finished?

[Tom looks at Violet, his polite pride fading to curiosity.]

TOM
I have.

VIOLET
Good. Please take off your coat.

[Tom looks at Isobel for help, his mouth open in surprise, but her expression doesn't change.]

VIOLET
Molesley, do help him.

[Molesley steps up to Tom.]

MR MOLESLEY
If you'll just slip it off, sir.

[Tom gives up with a sigh and unbuttons his coat, clearing his throat. Molesley helps him out of it and picks up the morning coat.]

VIOLET
Shouldn't he put the waistcoat on first?

[Molesley helps Tom into the morning coat as Matthew enters.]

MATTHEW
What's going on?

TOM
They're forcing me into a morning coat.

MATTHEW
He has no say in it?

VIOLET
No, he doesn't, and nor do you.

[Matthew raises an eyebrow and he and Tom look at each other. Molesley finishes adjusting the morning coat.]

VIOLET
Well, what do you think, Molesley?

MR MOLESLEY
It'll need lifting a little hem, milady.

VIOLET
Mm-hmm.

MR MOLESLEY
We'll move the buttons so.

VIOLET
Well, I think the shoulders

[Molesley inspects the shoulders with tilts of his head.]

--
[00:42:18, EXT. DOWNTON ABBEY, FRONT DOOR - DAY]
[A red motorcar arrives. The servants and family are lined up to greet it. Robert and Cora step forward to welcome Cora's mother. Alfred hands Mrs Levinson out of the motorcar.]

MRS LEVINSON
Come war and peace, Downton still stands and the Crawleys are still in it. Cora.

[Mrs. Levinson steps forward to hug her daughter.]

CORA
Mother, how lovely to see you.

MRS LEVINSON
As long as it is. Robert, aren't you going to kiss me?

[Cora steps back and Robert steps forward.]

ROBERT
With the greatest enthusiasm.

[Robert gives Mrs Levinson a kiss on the cheek. Robert looks at the red motorcar.]

ROBERT
Tell me, where does this come from?

MRS LEVINSON
I hired it in Liverpool. Why?

ROBERT
Well, I thought it might be a gift from the U.S. government to help get Britain back on its feet.

[Mrs Hughes, Mr Carson, and Mrs Levinson chuckle. Mrs Levinson steps up to them.]

MRS LEVINSON
Carson and Mrs Hughes, the world has moved on since last we met.

MR CARSON
And we have moved on with it, my lady.

MRS LEVINSON
Really? (chuckle) It seems so strange to think of the English embracing change. Mrs Hughes, this is my maid, Reed.

[Reed and Mrs Hughes nod to each other, and Reed takes her place in the servant's line. Mrs Levinson turns to her grandchildren.]

MRS LEVINSON
Sybil, tell me all about the arrangements for the birth.

[Mrs Levinson embraces Sybil lightly and receives a kiss.]

MRS LEVINSON
We do these things so much better in the States.

[Mrs Levinson turns to the next girl.]

MRS LEVINSON
Edith, still no one special?

[Edith smiles with a sigh and a shrug.]

MRS LEVINSON
Well, never mind. You must take a tip from the modern American girl.

[Mrs Levinson proceeds to Mary.]

MRS LEVINSON
Ah, Mary. Dearest Mary.

[Mrs Levinson lightly embraces Mary to receive a kiss.]

MRS LEVINSON
Now. You tell me all of your wedding plans and I'll see what I can do to improve them.

[Mrs Levinson walks into the house. The family all exchange looks, recovering from the whirlwind American mother-in-law. Cora and Robert enter the house, the others following in order of rank.]

--
[00:43:56, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - DAY]
[O'Brien looks at Daisy, who's sitting at the table pouting with her arms crossed.]

O'BRIEN
What's the matter with you?

[Reed enters.]

DAISY
Mrs Patmore knows.

REED
Should I tell you Mrs Levinson's requirements during her stay?

DAISY
No, tell her.

MRS PATMORE
Er, yes. Miss Reed, how can I help?

REED
Well, to start with, I will need goat's milk in the mornings.

MRS PATMORE
Goat's milk? Oh, fancy that.

REED
She drinks only boiled water.

MRS PATMORE
Really?

REED
In England, that is.

ANNA
Shouldn't Daisy be doing this?

ALFRED
I ought to take the tea up.

MRS PATMORE
Oh, I'll have it ready in a moment.

[Mrs Patmore walks toward the kitchens. Daisy wathes with pursed lips, her arms still crossed.]

REED
No fats, no crab, and nothing from the marrow family.

[Mrs Patmore walks out with Reed and Daisy's stiff demeanor fades into uncertainty.]

--
[00:44:28, INT. LIBRARY - DAY]

MRS LEVINSON
Do explain again how exactly you are related to all of us, Mr Crawley.

[Matthew sighs with some amusement.]

MATTHEW
Rather distantly, I'm afraid.

[Tom places his hand over Sybil's affectionately and she smiles back at him.]

MATTHEW
My great, great grandfather was a younger son of the third earl.

[Isobel chuckles.]

MRS LEVINSON
My. Hm, I'm going to have to write that down so I can study it.

ROBERT
Look at our page in Burke's. You'll find Matthew there.

MRS LEVINSON
Good, because I would so like to understand why he gets to inherit my late husband's money.

MATTHEW
(chuckle) I know, it's funny isn't it?

[Cora and Mary chuckle.]

MRS LEVINSON
Not everyone shares your sense of humour.

ISOBEL
But surely it doesn't matter now that they're getting married.

[Mrs Levinson tips her head up in acknowledgement.]

MARY
In fact, we'd better turn him out, or it'll be bad luck for tomorrow.

CORA
Quite right.

[Matthew looks at his watch and stands. The gentlemen stand as Cora and Mary exit with him.]

MRS LEVINSON
You must be the chauffeur I've heard so much about.

TOM
I am, ma'am.

SYBIL
Tom's a journalist now, Grandmamma.

MRS LEVINSON
Oh, well, well. I've heard of those journeys on my side of the water. It's very pleasant to hear of them happening here.

[Robert looks less than pleased, but Tom and Sybil smile.]

--
[00:45:32, INT. GREAT HALL - DAY]
[Cora walks with Mary and Matthew.]

MARY
It's all right, Mamma. You can leave us unchaperoned. After tomorrow, all things are permitted.

[Cora chuckles with a blush.]

CORA
Don't embarrass me. Bye Matthew.

[She squeezes his arm on her way out.]

CORA
Get a good night's sleep.

[Mary and Matthew look around the hall.]

MARY
How many moments of Crawley history has this room seen?

MATTHEW
And many more to come.

[Mary tenses.]

MARY
I hope so. In fact, what happened in the search for...Mr Pumpkin...

[Matthew looks down with an amused smile.]

MARY
...Swire's heir? Have you heard anything?

MATTHEW
Yes. Charkham sent a telegram. I've got it here, actually.

MARY
Oh.

[Matthew hands her the telegram and she reads it.]

MARY
"Convincing proof of Pulbrook's death. Stop. Investigating date." W--what does that mean?

MATTHEW
Well, if Pulbrook died after Reggie, then his heirs get the money, but if he died first, then I do.

[Mary's brow furrows.]

MARY
But that's absurd. What right have his heirs to inherit anything?

MATTHEW
Well, darling, what right have I? And frankly, what difference does it make? I shan't keep it if I get it.

MARY
Well...actually, you will.

[Matthew's brows furrow.]

MARY
Because something rather terrible has happened.

[Matthew steps toward her with curiosity.]

MARY
You see...apparently Papa has lost a great deal of money.

[Matthew looks suddenly toward the library and back at Mary.]

MARY
Enough to ruin him. Enough for us to lose Downton.

MATTHEW
Oh, God, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

MARY
Yes, but...surely, if Mr Pulbrook did die before Swire, then...we're saved.

[Matthew's expression darkens.]

MATTHEW
Darling, I don't think you understand.

[Matthew steps away.]

MATTHEW
Reggie Swire will have got me in his will because he believed I was his daughter's one true love.

MARY
So you were.

[Matthew jerks violently.]

MATTHEW
Yes, but...

[Matthew walks slowly back to Mary.]

MATTHEW
But I broke Lavinia's heart and she died. He never knew that.

[Mary stares at Matthew, mouth open, brows furrowed.]

MATTHEW
How could I possibly allow myself to...profit from her death. To--to...dine in splendour, because I took away a woman's will to live.

MARY
So, you're prepared to destroy us in payment for your destroying her?

MATTHEW
Darling, please. You know I would do anything for this family.

MARY
Anything except help us.

[Matthew's expression darkens again. Mary becomes increasingly upset.]

MARY
Except save Papa from living out the rest of his days in humiliation and grief. And what about us? What about our children? Oh, God, Matthew, how can you be so disappointing?

[Mary breaks down in tears.]

MATTHEW
Mary, please.

MARY
No!

[Mary backs away from Matthew's comfort.]

MARY
Don't you see what this means? Don't you see what a difference this makes? It means that you're not on our side, Matthew. It means that deep down, you're not on our side!

ANNA
How are you getting on with your new companion?

BATES
I don't like him, but so far I've kept it to myself. So...who are the bridesmaids?

[Anna smiles.]

ANNA
You don't care about all that.

BATES
You're wrong. It's the stuff of my dreams.

[Bates smiles.]

BATES
The panic that a dinner won't be ready, or a frock isn't ironed, or a gun wasn't cleaned.

[Anna sighs with a smile.]

BATES
Do you know where you're going for the honeymoon?

ANNA
Oh, I want to talk about that. They'll stay in London with Lady Rosamund for a couple of days just to get used to each other.

[Anna lets out a small chuckle and they both smile at each other.]

ANNA
And then they go to the south of France. I'll hire a replacement in London, and then I'll come home instead. Lady Mary won't mind. I'll pay.

BATES
Why would you do that?

ANNA
Well, to be near you, of course.

BATES
Don't you understand? While I'm in here, you have to live my life as well as your own. Go to France, see some sights. Get us some memories.

ANNA
But I wouldn't be home for a month.

BATES
But we'd have something to talk about. Go. I insist.

[Anna studies Bates.]

BATES
For my sake.

[Anna considers his request.]

--
[00:49:30, INT. GREAT HALL - EVENING]
[Violet enters with Carson.]

VIOLET
I was so afraid I was going to be late. But th-- Ah-ha-ha.

[Violet sees Mrs Levinson and they greet one another.]

MRS LEVINSON
Violet.

[Violet opens her arms and embraces Violet, who stands there accepting it awkwardly. Mrs Levinson steps back with a smile, then looks at Violet's face.]

MRS LEVINSON
Oh, dear.

[Violet's smile is frozen.]

MRS LEVINSON
I'm afraid the war has made old women of us both.

[Carson raises his eyebrows and exits.]

VIOLET
Oh, I wouldn't say that. But then, I always keep out of the sun. How do you find Downton on your return?

MRS LEVINSON
Much the same, really. Probably too much the same, but then I don't want to cast a pall over all the happiness.

VIOLET
How could you ever do that?

[They start walking toward the drawing room.]

MRS LEVINSON
Tell me, what do you think of young Lochinvar who has so ably carried off our granddaughter and our money?

VIOLET
Oh.

MRS LEVINSON
Do you approve of him?

VIOLET
Not as much as you will, when you get to know him.

MRS LEVINSON
Hmm. Has he gone home to change?

VIOLET
Oh, no. We won't see him again tonight. The groom never sees the bride the night before the wedding.

MRS LEVINSON
Ha. Nothing ever alters for you people, does it? Revolutions erupt and monarchies crash to the ground, and the groom still cannot see the bride before the wedding.

VIOLET
You Americans never understand the importance of tradition.

MRS LEVINSON
Yes, we do. We just don't give it power over us. History and tradition took Europe into a world war. Maybe you should think about letting go of its hand.

[Mrs Levinson pats Violet's arms and walks off. Edith enters to find Violet staring after Cora's mother.]

EDITH
There you are. I see you've said hello to Grandmamma.

VIOLET (whisper)
She is like a homing pigeon. She finds our underbelly every time. Dreadful woman.

[Violet walks to the drawing room.]

--
[00:51:08, INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING]

ROBERT
No, it wasn't me. (to Mrs Levinson) Someone sent Sybil and Tom the price for the tickets to come over.

[Mary is silent and tense from her fight with Matthew.]

SYBIL
Does it matter who it was? It meant we could be at the wedding. Of course, I wish it had been you, Papa, but I don't mind. I thank them, whoever they are.

CORA
Well, I'm very glad you're here, but it wasn't me either, I'm sad to say.

MRS LEVINSON
Well, I love a mystery. Who could it be?

ROBERT
My guess is Cousin Isobel. She always likes to stick her oar in.

SYBIL
I'm going to ask her.

VIOLET
For heaven's sake, it was me.

[Robert looks up in shock, putting down his spoon. Even Mary is shocked out of her nervous state, and Tom looks up in surprise.]

SYBIL
You? But it wasn't your writing.

VIOLET
No. Smithers did it. Like all ladies' maids, she lives for intrigue.

TOM
You wanted me to come here?

VIOLET
I wanted Sybil and her husband to be here for Mary's wedding, yes.

[Carson drops Tom's napkin on him with a grimace, for Tom to put in his lap.]

SYBIL
Why keep that secret?

VIOLET
Silly, wasn't it?

[Mary stares at the table, her brows furrowed.]

TOM
I'm very touched. I'll admit it.

MRS LEVINSON
How democratic. Makes me think maybe I've been mistaken in you.

VIOLET
I am a woman of many parts. After all, Branson is a me-- I mean, Tom. Ha. You're a member of the family now.

[The corner of Tom's mouth turns up into a smile.]

VIOLET
You'll find we Crawleys stick together.

MARY
Not always.

[Mary mopes.]

CORA
Mary, what is it?

MARY
Oh, nothing. It's just...

[Mary can't hold it in. She leaves the table in tears. Tom and Robert stand and Violet reaches her hand out to Mary's retreating figure.]

VIOLET
Oh, Mary, dear...

--
[00:52:31, INT. KITCHENS - EVENING]
[Alfred enters.]

MRS PATMORE
Oh, there you are. That's all for this course.

[Mrs Patmore places a gravy boat on Alfred's serving tray.]

MRS PATMORE
Don't you think, Daisy?!

[Mrs Patmore shouts down the table where Daisy is sitting with pursed lips and arms crossed.]

ALFRED
Is Daisy all right, Mrs Patmore?

MRS PATMORE
Oh, yes. She's been such a big help. Now, I think we should check the pudding, Daisy. Don't you agree?!

[Daisy doesn't move.]

--
[00:52:49, INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING]

CORA
It's nerves. Everyone cries at some point before their wedding.

MRS LEVINSON
But what was the quarrel about?

EDITH
I'm not sure. I know she accused him of not being on our side.

VIOLET
Oh, well, I hope she's wrong. That could be rather serious.

ROBERT
Of course he's on our side. It's ridiculous. I'll go and see him.

TOM
No, I'll go.


[Robert looks at Tom in unpleasant surprise.]

TOM
I'm his best man. I should be the one to go.

ROBERT
What?

TOM
I know what it is to marry into this family. I'm not comparing myself to Mr Crawley, but he is another kind of outsider.

ROBERT
Well, I hardly--

MRS LEVINSON
Well, why not? He's the one that will lose his job if the wedding's cancelled.

[Robert and Tom regard each other for a moment, then they leave the subject.]

--
[00:53:26, INT. KITCHENS - EVENING]
[Daisy approaches Mrs Patmore proudly.]

DAISY
I see what you're doing, you know.

MRS PATMORE
What's that then?

DAISY
Not responding to my protest.

MRS PATMORE
Oh, "Not responding to my protest". Very elegant, I must say.

[Mrs Patmore turns to Daisy with a hand on her hip.]

MRS PATMORE
Who've you been talking to? Thomas?

[Daisy is caught with no response.]

DAISY
Well...

[Mrs Patmore tilts her head, waiting for an answer.]

DAISY
Oh, just give me the cloth and I'll dry.

[Mrs Patmore tosses Daisy the cloth in victory.]

--
[00:53:52, INT. LADY MARY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT]
[Mary cries as Anna brushes her hair.]

ANNA
But suppose he never gets the money.

MARY
It's not about the money. It's that he won't save Papa when he could.

ANNA
But he has to be true to himself.

MARY
Well, that's the point. He puts himself above the rest of us. Don't you see?

ANNA
What I see is a good man, milady.

[Mary looks up at Anna in the mirror, listening wholeheartedly.]

ANNA
And they're not like buses. There won't be another one along in ten minutes time.

[Anna puts the hair brush down and goes about her business while Mary thinks over what she said.]

--
[00:54:24, INT. CRAWLEY HOUSE - NIGHT]
[Tom and Matthew have a drink in the living room.]

TOM
It seems big, but it's not big.

MATTHEW
And if it happens? I get the money? I can't do what she wants.

TOM
It's strange for me to be arguing about inherited money and saving estates when the old me would like to put a bomb under the lot of you.

[Tom and Matthew both smile in amusement.]

MATTHEW
But?

TOM
But you're meant to be together.

[Matthew smiles a little.]

TOM
I've known that as long as I've been at the house. And at first this kept you apart, and then that kept you apart...

[Matthew looks upwards, remembering.]

TOM
But please don't risk it a third time. Because I'll tell you this: you won't be happy with anyone else while Lady Mary walks the earth.

[Matthew closes his eyes at Tom's social faux pas.]

MATTHEW
Call her Mary, please.

TOM
Never mind what I call her. I know what I'll call you if you let this chance slip through your fingers.

[Matthew chuckles and smiles at Tom.]

--
[00:55:19, INT. LADY MARY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT]
[Someone knocks at Mary's door as she's sitting on the bed in her nightgown. She stares at it and Anna goes to it slowly. Anna opens the door to find Matthew at the door, Tom behind him. Anna looks back at Mary.]

MATTHEW
I just need a word.

[Mary stands up at Matthew's voice.]

MARY
No. Go away. I'm undressed, you can't come in.

MATTHEW
One word. Come to the door.

TOM
Please. Just give him this chance.

[Mary walks toward the door at the sound of Tom's voice.]

MATTHEW
I won't look at you.

ANNA
It'd be unlucky if you did.

MARY
Only if we were getting married.

MATTHEW
Which we are.

[Anna looks at Mary and asks with a tilt of her head. Mary nods that she'll talk with Matthew and Anna leaves with a smile. Matthew looks back and Tom, who gives him an encouraging smile, and Tom and Anna both disappear.]

MATTHEW
My darling, I refuse to quarrel about something that hasn't happened and probably never will.

MARY
That's what Anna says.

MATTHEW
And she's right. My darling, I'm sure we will fight about...money...and about Downton...about how to rear our children, about any number of other things.

MARY
Then shouldn't we accept it? Matthew...I've been thinking...and I'm not angry now. Truly, I'm not. But if we can disagree over something as fundamental as this, then...shouldn't we be brave and back away now?

MATTHEW
No.

MARY
It's not because you're afraid of calling it off, because I'm not.

MATTHEW
No...

[Matthew takes a breath trying to form the words.]

MATTHEW
It's because of something Tom said.

[Mary's eyebrows furrow as she waits for his answer.]

MATTHEW
That I would never be happy with anyone else as long as you walked the earth. Which is true. And...I think you feel the same about me.

[Mary thinks about it and raises her eyebrows when she realises the truth.]

MATTHEW
Can I kiss you?

[Mary turns her head in surprise.]

MATTHEW
'Cause I need to.

[Mary smiles.]

MATTHEW
Very much.

MARY
No. It's bad luck to look at me.

MATTHEW
What about if I close my eyes and you do too.

[Mary thinks about it for a moment.]

MARY
All right. But you mustn't cheat.

[Mary waits for Matthew to step around the open door. He steps inside with a smile and she feels her way forward with a hand on his chest. Her hand slides to his face and they kiss. When they pull apart, Mary opens her eyes. They both smile, though Matthew's eyes are still closed. Mary stands there with her hand on his chest and closes her eyes again.]

MATTHEW
Goodnight.

[They both smile again and Matthew steps backward out of her room. Mary opens her eyes and looks at the floor dreamily.]

--
ACT FIVE
[00:58:08, INT. GREAT HALL - MORNING]
[Tom descends the stairs in full morning coat apparel. He encounters Robert in the hall.]

TOM
Right. I'm off to collect Matthew.

ROBERT
You look very smart.

TOM
I hope so. Because I'm extremely uncomfortable.

[Tom chuckles with a smile as he fidget with his sleeve. He begins to head out again.]

ROBERT
Branson.

[Tom stops. Robert exhales.]

ROBERT
That is...Tom.

[Tom walks back toward Robert.]

ROBERT
I want to thank you for what you did last night. I'm grateful. I mean it.

TOM
We're both strong characters. I'd say we have plenty of slamming doors and shouting matches to come.

[Robert is aghast for a moment, then he recovers himself with a sigh.]

ROBERT
Forgive me, I was about to be indignant, but of course, you have a perfect right to speak as you do.

TOM
I hope you mean that, too.

ROBERT
I do. Now, hurry up.

[They smile at each other and Tom exits.]

--
[00:58:54, INT. LADY MARY'S BEDROOM - MORNING]
[Anna finishes up Mary's hair with a laurel tiara.]

CORA
You'd ask, wouldn't you, if there was anything you wanted me to tell you. I mean, I'm sure you know.

MARY
More than you did.

[Cora exhales.]

MARY
And relax. There isn't anything I need to hear now.

CORA
Because when two people love each other, you understand, everything...

[Sybil raises her eyebrows, waiting for their mother's response.]

CORA
Is the most terrific fun.

[Sybil laughs.]

MARY
Careful, Mamma, or you'll shock Anna.

ANNA
I'm a married woman now, milady.

[The married ladies chuckle.]

EDITH
I think we should go.

SYBIL
What about Anna? How are you going to get to the church?

ANNA
They're waiting for me in the wagonette. I'll see you there.

[Anna steps back and Mary turns around on her chair. Sybil kneels down in front of her.]

SYBIL
I know mine was a wild runaway marriage, darling, and yours is the one everyone wanted, but what's so thrilling is that this is every bit as romantic.

MARY
Thank you. For always being so sweet.

[They kiss each other on the cheek and Sybil stands back. Mary stands and Edith faces her.]

EDITH
Love and position in one handsome package. Who could ask for more?

[Mary exhales and gives Cora a sidelong look as Edith leaves with Sybil. Mary faces Cora.]

CORA
Never mind Edith. Well...

[Cora steps up to Mary.]

CORA
Very, very good luck my beautiful daughter.

[Cora squeezes Mary's hands and leaves. Anna steps forward and unties the robe over Mary's wedding gown.]

--
[01:00:21, INT/EXT. FRONT DOOR - MORNING]
[Mrs Hughes brings the flower girls to their motorcar.]

MRS HUGHES
Now, you've a great big motorcar all to yourselves. Just think of that. So we'll expect you to behave as if you were quite grown up. You can do that, can't you?

[One of the flower girls runs over to O'Brien.]

O'BRIEN
Have you got everything you need?

FLOWER GIRL
Yes.

O'BRIEN
[?] then. Careful of your dress.

[O'Brien opens the car door for the girl. The girls giggle as they sit together.]

O'BRIEN
Settle down.

MRS HUGHES
All right?

[Alfred closes the car door on the other side and leans in the window.]

ALFRED
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

FLOWER GIRLS
We won't.

MRS HUGHES.
Buh-bye.

ALFRED
[?]

[The motorcar drives off. A large horse drawn carriage pulls up to the front door.]

--
[01:01:02, INT. KITCHENS - MORNING]
[Daisy and Mrs Patmore are busy arranging a beautiful array of appetisers.]

MRS HUGHES
Have you got everything you need?

MRS PATMORE
We do. Now, be off with you and enjoy yourself.

[Mrs Hughes leaves.]

DAISY
I wish we were going.

MRS PATMORE
And who would get the food ready for when they come back? But still, fetch your coat, and we'll see her off.

[Daisy smiles and they exit.]

--
[01:01:19, INT. GREAT HALL - MORNING]
[The family walks toward the front door, Edith and Sybil arm in arm.]

ROBERT
Right. See you in a minute.

[Sybil and Edith smile at Robert as they follow their mother out.]

SYBIL
And so should you.

[Carson enters.]

MR CARSON
They just leaving now, my lord, as soon as we've got Anna.

ROBERT
Ah.

[Anna calls down the stairs.]

ANNA
Here comes the bride.

[Robert and Carson look up as Anna descends with a bouquet. Mary walks down, her veil flowing out behind her. Robert and Carson's jaws drop at the sight of her and step forward.]

MARY
Will I do, Carson?

[Mary smiles. Carson looks at her in awe with tears in his eyes.]

MR CARSON
Very nicely, my lady.

[Mary steps down to the hall and her father meets her.]

ROBERT
Thank heavens you got everything settled. You had me worried.

MARY
It's not quite settled, I'm afraid. He won't get off that easily.

ROBERT
But you're happy?

MARY
I am.

[Robert nods.]

MARY
And what about you?

[Robert takes a breath before he speaks.]

ROBERT
I'm so happy...so very happy, I feel my chest will explode.

[Robert kisses Mary's cheek with tears in his eyes. He offers her his arm and they walk toward the front door together.]

--
[01:02:51, INT. DOWNTON CHURCH - MORNING]
[Edith finds Sir Anthony.]

EDITH
It's so lovely that you're here. Come behind us.

SIR ANTHONY
I can't, I'm not family.

EDITH
Well, you almost are.

[Anthony scoffs and allows Edith to lead him to his seat. Matthew and Tom arrive and hand their hats to a servant.]

MATTHEW
Morning. Thank you.

TOM
Thank you.

[Matthew addresses Molesley in a back row.]

MATTHEW
Molesley.

[Molesley stands and O'Brien watches them.]

MATTHEW
I'm very grateful to you for keeping Mr Branson up to the mark. We both are, aren't we?

TOM
We certainly are.

MOLESLEY
Thank you, sir.

[Tom and Matthew walk toward the altar and Molesley catches O'Brien's eye. He smiles at her, but she turns away. Mrs Hughes and Mr Carson sit in a pew together.]

MR CARSON
This is a proud day, Mrs Hughes.

MRS HUGHES
I don't know if I'm proud, but I'm very glad you're happy, Mr Carson.

[Cora leans over to Edith.]

CORA
You're next, darling, you'll see.

EDITH
Will I?

[Cora smiles and takes Edith's hand. Cora and Mrs Levinson sit together.]

VIOLET
It's so encouraging to see the future unfurl.

[Mrs Levinson looks over at Violet coolly.]

MRS LEVINSON
As long as you remember it will bear no resemblance to the past.

--
[, EXT. DOWNTON VILLAGE - MORNING]
[Church bells chime and the villagers wave flags and cheer as Lady Mary's carriage drives toward the church. They follow it to the gate and continue cheering as Robert and Mary step out. Matthew and Tom hear the crowd's cheers as they sit in the front pew. They look at each other and smile. The organ starts and Tom leans over just as everyone stands.]

TOM
Good luck.

[Tom and Matthew face the altar as Robert walks Mary down the aisle. Matthew peeks around his shoulder to see Mary smiling at him. He returns the smile. Robert leads Mary to the altar and steps back. Matthew leans over.]

MATTHEW
You came. To be honest, I wasn't completely sure you would.

MARY
I'm glad to hear it. I should hate to be predictable.
