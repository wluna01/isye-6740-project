[00:30, EXT. DOWNTON ABBEY, GROUNDS - DAY]
[Bates walks out of the front gate.]

--
[00:43, INT. POST OFFICE - DAY]

POSTMISTRESS
There you are, Mr Bates, it's in. Came this morning.

[The woman hands Bates a paper.]

MR BATES
I said it would, which isn't quite the same thing.

[Gwen enters the shop and is surprised to run into Bates.]

MR BATES
Hello. I could've posted that for you.

GWEN
Well, I prefer to do it myself.

MR BATES
I'll wait outside.

[Gwen waits for Bates to pass, then approaches the counter and eagerly passes her parcel to the postmistress.]

--
[01:06, INT. HOUSEMAIDS' BEDROOM - DAY]
[Anna stands on a chair trying to move a large case on top of the cupboard, but it won't budge. Gwen enters and Anna almost falls.]

GWEN
What are you doing?

ANNA
If you must know, I'm trying to find some space on top of the cupboard to make life easier.

[Gwen closes the door and Anna gets off the chair.]

ANNA
So, what's in it, then?

GWEN
What?

ANNA
The bleeding great packing case that weighs a ton, that's what.

GWEN
Can't you just leave it?

ANNA
No, I can't. And you'll tell me right now.

--
[01:39, EXT. DOWNTON ABBEY, GROUNDS - DAY]
[Cora walks up to the bench where Mary is reading a letter.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Anything interesting?

LADY MARY
Not particularly. It's from Evelyn Napier. You met him at the Delta Fields last November at Doncaster races.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Is that Lord Branksome's boy?

LADY MARY
It is.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Do you like him?

LADY MARY
I don't dislike him.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
And what's he writing about?

LADY MARY
Oh, nothing much. He's out with the York and Ainsty next week. He'll meet us at Downton. He'll want some tea when he's up here.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Where's he staying? With friends?

LADY MARY
He says he's found a pub that caters for hunting.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Well, we can improve on that. He must come here. He can send the horses up early if he wants.

LADY MARY
He'll know why you're asking him.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I can't think what you mean. His mother's a friend of mine; she'll be pleased at the idea.

LADY MARY
Not very pleased. She's dead.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
All the more reason, then. You can write a note, too, and put it in with mine.

[Mary sighs and Cora gets up to leave.]

LADY MARY
Should I tell him about your friendship with his late mother?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I'm sure you of all people can compose a letter to a young man without any help from me.

--
[02:41, INT. HOUSEMAIDS' ROOM - DAY]
[Anna and Gwen stare down at the typewriter that they pulled out of the packing case on top of the cupboard.]

ANNA
How much did it cost?

GWEN
Every penny I'd saved. Al-- almost.

ANNA
And...i--is this the mystery lover?

GWEN
Well, I've been taking a correspondence course in typing and shorthand. That's what was in the envelopes.

ANNA
Are you any good?

GWEN
Yes. I am, actually.

[O'Brien opens the door and Gwen and Anna move to block the typewriter from view.]

MISS OBRIEN
Eh, Her Ladyship wants the full skirt Lady Mary never wears. A seamstress is going to fit it to Lady Sybil, but I can't find it.

ANNA
I'll come in a minute.

MISS OBRIEN
They're waiting now.

ANNA
One minute. I'm just changing my cap and apron.

[O'Brien looks at them suspiciously and leaves. Anna closes the door.]

ANNA
Have you told anyone?

[Gwen shakes her head.]

ANNA
What did your parents say?

GWEN
Well, I can't tell them till I've got a job. Dad will think I'm a fool to leave a good place and Mum will say I'm getting above myself, but...but I don't believe that.

ANNA
Nor do I.

--
[03:42, INT. LIBRARY - DAY]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
It's not of my doing. It's all Mary's own work, but I think we should encourage it.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Branksome's a dull dog, but I don't suppose that matters.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Did you know his wife had died?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
He only ever talks about racing

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Cora is right. Mary won't take Matthew Crawley, so we'd better get her settled before the bloom is quite gone off the rose.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Is the family and old one?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Older than yours I imagine.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Old enough.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
And there's plenty of money.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Oh, really?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM (nods)
Mm.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Mama, you've already looked him up in the stud books and made inquiries about the fortune, don't pretend otherwise. Are you afraid someone will think you're American if you speak openly?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I doubt it'll come to that.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Shall I ring for tea?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
No, not for me. I'm meeting Cripps at five. I'll see you at dinner.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
You don't seem very pleased.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I'm pleased. It's not brilliant, but I'm pleased.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
So...?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I don't want Robert to use a marriage as an excuse to stop fighting for Mary's inheritance.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
It won't make any difference. I don't think he has the slightest intention of fighting as it is. The price of saving Downton is to accept Matthew Crawley as his heir.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
What about you?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I don't dislike Matthew. In fact, I rather admire him.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Is that sufficient reason to give him your money?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Of course not!

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Then there's nothing more to be said. Are we going to have tea or not?

--
[05:09, INT. THE VILLAGE - DAY]
[Matthew rides his bicycle into the village and ring the bell on it as he comes upon Edith.]

LADY EDITH
Oh.

[Matthew tips his hat and gets off his bicycle.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Hello. I'd offer you a lift if I could.

LADY EDITH
It was you I was coming to see.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Oh, then your timing is matchless. I just got off the train.

LADY EDITH
The other day at dinner, Cousin Isobel was saying you wanted to see some of the local churches.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
She's right, I do. I want to know more about the county generally if I'm to live here.

LADY EDITH
Well, I thought I might show you a few of the nearer ones. We could take a picnic and make an outing of it.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
That's very kind.

LADY EDITH
Nonsense. I'll enjoy it. It's too long since I played the tourist.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
It would have to be a Saturday. Churches work on Sunday and I work all the week days.

LADY EDITH
Then Saturday it is. I'll get Lynch to sort out the governess cart and I'll pick you up at about eleven.

[Edith walks back the way she came, all smiles, and Matthew tips his hat to her as she leaves.]

--
[06:02, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - DAY]
[The servants gather around the typewriter.]

DAISY
How does it work?

WILLIAM
It's easy. You just press the letters and they print on the paper.

[William presses a couple of keys to demonstrate. O'Brien shows Carson and Mrs Hughes into the room.]

MR CARSON
Get back, please.

MISS O'BRIEN
They were trying to hide it, so I knew it was wrong.

MR CARSON
Where's Gwen now?

THOMAS
Doing the dining room with Anna. They'll be finished soon.

MR CARSON
Then I'll wait.

MRS HUGHES
With all due respect, Mr Carson, Gwen is under my jurisdiction.

MR CARSON
Indeed she is, Mrs Hughes, and I have no intention of usurping your authority. I merely want to get to the bottom of it.

WILLIAM
Why shouldn't Gwen have a typewriter if she wants one?

THOMAS
Mind your own business.

[Gwen and Anna enter.]

GWEN
What's that doing here?

MRS HUGHES
Ah, Gwen. Come in.

GWEN
Why is that down here? Who's been in my room? They had no right!

MRS HUGHES
MR CARSON
See here! In the first place, none of the rooms in this house belong to you. And in the second, I am in charge of your welfare and that gives me every right.

ANNA (to O'Brien)
This is you isn't it?

MR CARSON
All we want is to know what Gwen wants with a typewriter and why she feels the need to keep it secret.

ANNA
She wants to keep it private, not secret. There's a difference.

MR BATES
Amen.

GWEN
I've done nothing to be ashamed of. I've bought a typewriter and I've taken a postal course in shorthand. I'm not aware that either of these actions is illegal.

MRS HUGHES
Will you tell us why, preferably without any more cheek?

[Gwen hesitates.]

GWEN
Because I want to leave service. I want to be a secretary.

[Mr Carson and Mrs Hughes exchange a shocked look.]

MRS HUGHES
You want to leave service?

MISS O'BRIEN
What's wrong with being in service?

GWEN
Nothing's wrong with it, and there's nothing wrong with mending roads neither, but it's not what I want to do.

MR CARSON
I should remind you that there are plenty of young girls who will be glad of a position in this house.

GWEN
And when I hand in my notice, I shall be happy to think one of them will be taking my place.

MISS O'BRIEN
What makes you think we'll wait till then?

ANNA
Are you hiring and sacking now, Miss O'Brien? I thought that lay with Mr Carson and Mrs Hughes.

MR CARSON
Enough of this. I'm going to ring the dressing gong and we'll have no more talk of this tonight.

GWEN
Can I have my machine back now?

MR CARSON
Very well. But I wish I was sure you know what you're doing.

MRS PATMORE
Daisy! What's happened to you? I said you could go for a drink of water, not a trip up the Nile.

--
[08:13, INT. LADY MARY'S BEDROOM - EVENING]
[Anna laces Mary into her corset while Edith sits at the vanity.]

ANNA
Which churches will you show him?

LADY EDITH
I can't decide. Kirby, possibly, or perhaps Easingwold.

LADY MARY
You don't think you're being a bit obvious?

LADY EDITH
Coming from you, that's rich.

[Cora enters.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
There was a letter from Mr Napier in the evening post.

LADY MARY
Mm. Did he accept?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Not yet.

LADY EDITH
Perhaps he thought it was too obvious.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Apparently he's bringing a friend with him, an attaché at the Turkish embassy. A Mr...

[Cora pulls out the letter to read the name.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Kemal Pamuk. He's a son of one of the sultan's ministers and he's here for the Albanian talks.

LADY MARY
What's that?

LADY EDITH
To create an independent Albania. Don't you read the papers?

LADY MARY
I'm too busy living a life.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Since Turkey's signature is vital, Mr Napier's been given the job of keeping him happy until the conference begins and he's eager to try an English hunt. I shall invite this Mr Pamuk to stay here as well. Who knows? A little hospitality in an English house may make all the difference to the outcome. And Mary, you will ride out with him.

LADY MARY
Oh, Mama, must I? My boots are at the menders and I haven't ridden for weeks.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Anna, please see that Lady Mary is fully equipped to go hunting.

ANNA
Yes, Your Ladyship.

[Mary isn't pleased.]

--
[09:28, EXT/INT. PROSTHETICS SHOP]
[Bates enters as the shopkeeper is making a false arm.]

ARTIFICIAL LIMBS MAN
Yes?

MR BATES
I saw this advertisement for a-- a limp corrector.

ARTIFICIAL LIMBS MAN
Yes?

MR BATES
What does it do exactly?

ARTIFICIAL LIMBS MAN
It corrects limps.

MR BATES
Does it work?

ARTIFICIAL LIMBS MAN
Well, as I make it and I advertise it, is it likely I'd say no?

MR BATES
Can I see one?

[The man fetches it from the back room.]

ARTIFICIAL LIMBS MAN
Here we are. You adjust this to the right height to minimize the limp. You tighten these gradually, as tight as you can stand, and as the legs straighten, the foot lowers to the floor. Can't say it's going to be easy, and you can't slack. Every day, all day if you mean business.

MR BATES
All right. How much?

--
[10:42, INT. CRAWLEY HOUSE - NIGHT]
[Isobel reads the contents of a letter aloud.]

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
She asks if we can both dine on Saturday. There are two young men staying, so you won't be so outnumbered for once.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
What men?

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
A...Turkish diplomat called something I can't read "and Lord Branksome's charming son", who's to be flung at Mary, presumably.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
When it comes to Cousin Mary, she's quite capable of doing her own flinging, I assure you.

[Isobel chuckles.]

--
[11:10, INT. GUEST BEDROOM - DAY]

ANNA
Ugh, open the door, can you?

[Gwen timidly opens the door and Anna goes about her chores.]

ANNA
I couldn't find her britches anywhere, so I asked Mr Bates and he looked among His Lordship's riding clothes. There they were. I only hope to God I've got everything.

[Gwen is clearly upset as Anna continues to work.]

ANNA
Hat I'll do here. Gloves and crop are in the hall.

[Gwen starts weeping and Anna notices.]

ANNA
Gwen? Whatever's the matter?

[Anna goes to comfort Gwen.]

ANNA
Hey, come on, sit down. Hey?

[Mr Bates sees them from the hall as they sit on the bed.]

MR BATES
What's happened?

GWEN
Oh...oh, I'm just being silly. You should get that brushed.

[Gwen nods to the clothes Bates's arm. Bates enters and closes the door.]

MR BATES
He won't be up for another half an hour. Now, what is it?

GWEN
Well, I suppose I've just realised that it's not going to happen.

MR BATES
What isn't?

GWEN
None of it. I'm not going to be a secretary. I'm not going to leave service. I doubt I'll leave here before I'm sixty.

ANNA
Hey, what's all this?

GWEN
Oh, you saw their faces. And their right. Oh, look at me! I'm the daughter of a farmhand, I'm lucky to be a maid. I was born with nothing and I'll die with nothing.

MR BATES
Don't talk like that. You can change your life if you want to. Sometimes you have to be hard on yourself, but you can change it completely, I know.

[Bates cringes.]

ANNA
Mr Bates? Are you all right?

MR BATES
Take her upstairs. Dry her off.

[Bates smiles and turns to open the door.]

ANNA
Come on, Gwen. Hey?

[The maids precede Bates through the door and walk down the corridor. Bates leans against the wall for support and Mrs Hughes finds him closing his eyes in pain.]

MRS HUGHES
Mr Bates? What's the matter?

MR BATES
Nothing. Not a thing. I'm fine.

MRS HUGHES
Let me help you.

MR BATES
I'm perfectly all right, thank you Mrs Hughes.

MRS HUGHES
Are you sure? You're as white as a sheet.

MR BATES
It's my wonderful complexion inherited from my Irish mother.

[Mrs Hughes contemplates his behaviour as she watches him walk away.]

[BREAK 1]

--
ACT TWO
[13:49, INT. KITCHENS - DAY]
[William and Thomas enter with empty trays. Thomas sneaks some dessert as the kitchen maids cut it and pour punch.]

MRS PATMORE
Take it. Take it, don't dawdle!

[The footmen take off with the trays of food and drink.]

--
[14:08, EXT. DOWNTON ABBEY, FRONT WALK - DAY]
[Carson stands at the door.]

MR CARSON
William.

[Carson directs where the footmen should bring the drinks. Lord and Lady Grantham greet the hunting party while the footmen serve those is hunting pink. The dogs beg for food from Thomas.]

LYNCH
Can you see them, milady?

LADY MARY
Not yet. Oh, wait a minute, here is Mr Napier. I was beginning to give up on you. We're moving off.

[Napier takes off his hat to Mary.]

EVELYN NAPIER
We were fools not to accept your mother's invitation and send the horses down early. As it is, my groom only got here an hour or two ago and my mount's as jump as a deb at her first ball.

LADY MARY
What about Mr Pamuk? I gather if he takes a tumble, you will be endangering world peace.

EVELYN NAPIER
Don't worry about Kemal. He knows what he's doing on a horse.

LADY MARY
Well, where is he?

EVELYN NAPIER
Fussing. He's rather a dandy.

LADY MARY
Well, I can see him now. A funny little foreigner with a wide, toothy grin and hair reeking with pomade.

EVELYN NAPIER
I wouldn't quite say that. Here he is now.

[Mary turns with a snobbish smile, but her jaw drops as he rides up.]

KEMAL PAMUK
Lady Mary Crawley, I presume?

[Pamuk takes off his hat to her.]

LADY MARY
You presume right.

KEMAL PAMUK
Sorry to be so dishevelled. We've been on a train since dawn and we had to change in a shed.

LADY MARY
You don't look dishevelled to me.

[Someone blows the hunting horn.]

LADY MARY
Lynch, you don't have to stay with me.

LYNCH
But His Lordship asked me to.

LADY MARY
It's a waste of your day. Help Mr Napier's man get their things back to house.

LYNCH
His Lordship said--

EVELYN NAPIER
Don't worry, I'll look after her.

KEMAL PAMUK
We'll make it our business to keep her from harm, I promise.

[The hunting party rides off, leaving Lynch behind.]

--
[16:37, EXT. DOWNTON ABBEY, GROUNDS - DAY]
[Mary sees Kemal stopping off to the side and rides to join him.]

LADY MARY
I hope the day is living up to your expectations.

KEMAL PAMUK
It is exceeding them in every way.

LADY MARY
And where's Mr Napier?

KEMAL PAMUK
He's gone over the bridge, look.

LADY MARY
Ah.

KEMAL PAMUK
And, er, what about you? Will you follow him? Or will you come over the jump with me?

[He nods to the fence in front of them.]

LADY MARY
Oh, I was never much one for going 'round by the road.

KEMAL PAMUK
Stay by me and we'll take it together.

[They ride back and jump the fence to ride through the mud.]

--
[17:37, INT. CHURCH - DAY]

LADY EDITH
I wish we could talk a little more about you. What was it like growing up in Manchester?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Does it say anything about the side aisle?

[Edith looks at a pamphlet.]

LADY EDITH
The side aisles were added in the 14th century by Bishop Richard De Warren.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Yes, you can see that in the...treatment of the stone.

LADY EDITH
It's wonderful to think of all those men and women worshipping together through the centuries, isn't it? Dreaming and hoping much as we do, I suppose.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Was the screen at Cromwell casualty?

LADY EDITH
I--I daresay.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I wonder how Mary's getting on.

LADY EDITH
All right, I should think. Why?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I just wonder. Will she stay with the hunt the whole day?

LADY EDITH
You know Mary, she likes to be in at the kill.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Where shall we go next?

LADY EDITH
Not home?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Oh, not yet. We've time for one more at least before we lose the light.

LADY EDITH
I underestimated your enthusiasm.

--
[18:50, EXT. DOWNTON ABBEY, FRONT WALK - DAY]
[Pamuk, Napier, and Mary dismount and walk toward the house in good spirits.]

KEMAL PAMUK
Come on.

--
[18:55, INT. ENTRYWAY/GREAT HALL - DAY]
[Thomas enters and approaches Carson as the party removes their riding clothes.]

THOMAS
Is that one mine?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Home is the hunter home from the hill.

[Robert sees the mud on Pamuk and Mary's ruffled hair.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Heavens, you have been in the wars.

LADY MARY
Papa, this is Mr Pamuk. My father, Lord Grantham.

KEMAL PAMUK
How do you do, my lord?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Did you have a good day?

KEMAL PAMUK
Couldn't have been better.

MR CARSON
This is Thomas, sir. He'll be looking after you.

LADY MARY
You remember Mr Napier.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Of course. How are you?

EVELYN NAPIER
So kind of you to have us, Lady Grantham.

LADY MARY
And this is Mr Pamuk.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
How do you do?

KEMAL PAMUK
My lady.

[Pamuk bows to kiss Cora's hand.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Well, what would you like?

LADY MARY
Just baths. We're worn out.

THOMAS
Erm, your cases are upstairs, sir, if you'd like to follow me.

KEMAL PAMUK
Yes.

[Anna enters one of the servants' corridors where O'Brien and Gwen are peering out. Thomas gives them an eye as he leads Pamuk to his guest room.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM (background)
Well, I hope Mary hasn't left you too exhausted.

EVELYN NAPIER (background)
No, not a bit of it.

GWEN
He doesn't look Turkish at all.

ANNA
Well, he doesn't look like any Englishman I've ever met. Worse luck. I think he's beautiful.

[Carson enters to find the three maids standing just inside the servants' door.]

MR CARSON
Is there some crisis of which I am unaware?

MISS O'BRIEN
No, Mr Carson

MR CARSON
I cannot think of another reason why you should congregate here.

ANNA
No, Mr Carson.

[The maids go their separate ways as footmen enter.]

--
[20:08, INT. LORD GRANTHAM'S DRESSING ROOM - EVENING]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Have you seen our visitor? Quite a treat for the ladies.

MR BATES
Indeed, milord.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Are they settled in all right?

MR BATES
I think so. Mr Napier's valet seems a competent fellow and Thomas knows what he's doing.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Why doesn't the gorgeous Turk have his own chap?

MR BATES
Apparently his man speaks no English, so Mr Pamuk decided to leave him in London.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Probably very wise. I hope Thomas doesn't mind.

MR BATES
Oh, you know Thomas, milord. He has to have a grumble, but I gather he cheered up when he saw the gentleman.

[Bates sucks in a breath when he steps with his bad leg.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Bates, is anything wrong?

MR BATES
Nothing at all, milord. Is that strap too tight?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Mm.

--
[20:41, INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT]

THOMAS
Can I adjust it, sir?

[Thomas fixes the vest strap.]

KEMAL PAMUK
Now, I'm relying on you to see that I go downstairs properly dressed.

THOMAS
Don't worry, sir. I've got sharp eyes for anything out of order.

KEMAL PAMUK
Then I put myself entirely in your hands.

THOMAS
You do right, sir.

[Thomas hands Pamuk a bowtie.]

THOMAS
I should love to visit Turkey.

KEMAL PAMUK
Yes, it's a...it's a wonderful country.

[Pamuk can't tie his bowtie and gives up in frustration.]

KEMAL PAMUK
My man always does this. Can you?

[Thomas ties the bowtie.]

THOMAS
I'm very attracted to the Turkish culture.

KEMAL PAMUK
Then I hope your chance will come to something.

THOMAS
I hope so, too.

[Thomas cups Pamuk's face in his hand, but Pamuk jerks away from his touch.]

KEMAL PAMUK
You forget yourself!

THOMAS
I--I'm sorry, sir. I--

KEMAL PAMUK
That will teach you to believe what the English say about foreigners. I ought to report you.

THOMAS
I think...you mist--

KEMAL PAMUK
I misunderstood nothing. But...I will make you an offer.

[Pamuk turns around to fix his bowtie.]

KEMAL PAMUK
Later tonight I may need some help with the...geography of house.

THOMAS
The geography?

KEMAL PAMUK
Yes. I'm not sure yet, but I may wish to pay someone a visit. If that is the case, you will help me...

[Pamuk turns back around.]

KEMAL PAMUK
And I will say nothing of your behaviour.

[Thomas nods.]

--
[22:11, INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I don't understand. Why--why would she want to be a secretary?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
She wants a different life.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
But why? I should far prefer to be a maid in a large and pleasant house than work from dawn till dusk in a cramped and gloomy office. Don't you agree, Carson?

MR CARSON
I do, my lady.

LADY MARY
Why are we talking about this? What does it matter?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
It matters that the people that live and work here are content.

LADY SYBIL
Of course. We should be helping Gwen if that's what she wants.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
I agree. Surely we must all encourage those less fortunate to improve their lot where they can.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Not if it isn't in their best interests.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Isn't the maid a better judge of that than we are?

LADY MARY
What do you say, Mr Pamuk? Should our housemaid be kept enslaved or forced out into the world?

KEMAL PAMUK
Why are you English so curious about other people's lives? If she wishes to leave, and the law permits it, then let her go.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
But perhaps the law should not permit it, for the common good.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
So, you hanker for the days of serfdom.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I hanker for a simpler world. Is that a crime?

KEMAL PAMUK
I do dream of a simpler world, as long as we can keep our trains and our dentistry.

[They chuckle.]

LADY MARY
I wish I shared your enthusiasm. Our dentist is horrid.

KEMAL PAMUK
Well, why go to him, then?

LADY MARY
Well, he treated all of us when we were children. You know how the English are about these things.

KEMAL PAMUK
Mm.

[Matthew watches Mary and Pamuk intently as they smile and chuckle at the other end of the table.]

KEMAL PAMUK
Well, the next time you feel a twinge, you must come to Istanbul.

LADY MARY
Wouldn't the journey be painful?

KEMAL PAMUK
Sometimes we must endure a little pain in order to achieve satisfaction.

EVELYN NAPIER
Lady Mary rode very well today.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Why did you send Lynch back?

LADY MARY
I had my champions to left and right. It was enough.

[Matthew doesn't seem to like that comment.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Did you enjoy the hunt today, Mr Napier? Mary said you had a tremendous run.

EVELYN NAPIER
It was like something out of a trollop novel.

[Robert chuckles.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
What about you, Mr Pamuk? Was your day successful?

KEMAL PAMUK
Oh, yes, Lady Grantham. I can hardly remember a better one.

[Mary seems to tense uncomfortably at the comment. Matthew isn't pleased.]

--
[24:18, INT. DRAWING ROOM - EVENING]
[Robert watches Mary talking with Napier, Pamuk, and Matthew Crawley.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Mary has more suitors tonight than the Princess Aurora.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Will she judge them sensibly?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Oh, no one's sensible at her age. Nor should they be. That's our role.

KEMAL PAMUK
Well, if you'll excuse me.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Was it fun to be back in the saddle?

LADY MARY
Yes. Although, I'll pay for it tomorrow.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Would you ever come out with me? Or aren't we friends enough for that?

LADY MARY
Oh, I think it might be--

EVELYN NAPIER
That run reminded me of a day last month up in Cheshire.

[Pamuk catches Mary's eye and nods for her to join him.]

EVELYN NAPIER
We came down the side of a hill and--

LADY MARY
Excuse me.

[Both men are surprised by her rudeness and obvious preference for Pamuk.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
It seems we must brush up on our powers of fascination.

EVELYN NAPIER
I was a fool to bring him here.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Don't you like him?

EVELYN NAPIER (scoffs)
Well, I like him very much, but so does everyone else, unfortunately.

[Edith smiles at Matthew and moves his way. Napier notices.]

EVELYN NAPIER
Excuse me.

[Napier leaves. Matthew notices as Edith steps up to him. He gives her a polite smile.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I hope I didn't wear you out today.

LADY EDITH
Not at all. I enjoyed it. We must do it again.

[Matthew watches Mary as Edith talks. Pamuk leaves the room.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Next time, let's take my mother. She was so jealous she made me promise she could come with us.

LADY EDITH
Of course. How nice that would be.

[Thomas notices Mary walk past him to follow Pamuk out of the room.]

LADY MARY
What is it?

KEMAL PAMUK
Is this picture really a Della Francesca?

LADY MARY
I think so. The second earl brought back several paintings from--

[Pamuk grabs Mary's face and kisses her furiously, pushing her against the wall.]

LADY MARY (whisper)
Mr Pamuk!

KEMAL PAMUK
Let me come to you tonight, please.

LADY MARY
I can't think what I have said that has led you to believe--

KEMAL PAMUK
Please. I don't know when we'll meet again. So let it be tonight.

[Pamuk leans in to kiss her again, but Mary pushes him back.]

LADY MARY
Mr Pamuk, I will not repeat your words to my father since I should hate to see you cast out into the darkness, but can we agree to consider them unsaid? Now, if you'll excuse me, I shall rejoin my mother and sisters.

[Mary returns to the drawing room. Pamuk watches her go, then smiles.]

--
[26:15, INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT]
[Thomas leads Pamuk through the house. Pamuk is wearing a dressing gown. Thomas stops at a door and nods. Pamuk nods and enters.]

--
[26:27, INT. LADY MARY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT]
[Mary is reading in bed when Pamuk enters. She snaps the book shut, scrambles out of bed, and pulls the comforter to cover her nightgown. She keeps her voice to a whisper.]

LADY MARY
You must be mad!

KEMAL PAMUK
I am. I am in the grip of madness.

LADY MARY
Please leave at once or I'll...

KEMAL PAMUK
Or you'll what?

LADY MARY
I'll scream.

KEMAL PAMUK
No, you won't.

LADY MARY
Well, I'll ring the bell, then.

KEMAL PAMUK
And who's on duty now? The hall boy? Will you really let him find a man in your bedroom? What a story.

LADY MARY
Do you have any idea what you're asking? I'd be ruined if they even knew we'd had this conversation, let alone if they--

KEMAL PAMUK
What? Don't worry. You can still be a virgin for your husband.

LADY MARY
Heavens, is this a proposal?

KEMAL PAMUK
Oh. Alas, no. I don't think our union would please your family.

LADY MARY
I'm afraid not.

KEMAL PAMUK
Nor mine. But...

[Pamuk steps close to her.]

KEMAL PAMUK
...a little imagination...you wouldn't be the first.

LADY MARY
You and my parents have something in common.

KEMAL PAMUK
Oh?

LADY MARY
You believe I'm...

[Pamuk begins to kiss her neck.]

LADY MARY
...much more of a rebel than I am. Now, please go.

[Pamuk lays her down on the bed as he kisses her.]

LADY MARY
I'm not what you think I am. If it's my mistake, if I've led you on, I'm sorry, but...I'm not.

KEMAL PAMUK
You are just what I think you are.

[Pamuk continues kissing her neck.]

LADY MARY
No. I've never done anything.

KEMAL PAMUK
Of course not. One look at you would tell me that.

[Pamuk finally kisses her on the lips.]

KEMAL PAMUK
Oh, my darling.

[Pamuk goes to kiss her again, but Mary stops him.]

LADY MARY
Won't it hurt? Is it safe?

KEMAL PAMUK
Trust me.

[Mary gives in and kisses him back and puts her arms around his neck.]

--
[28:26, INT. HOUSEMAIDS' BEDROOM - NIGHT]
[Mary puts her hand over Anna's mouth as she sleeps and Anna wakes. Mary puts a finger to her lips to hush Anna and beckons Anna to follow her. Gwen doesn't wake.]

[28:46, INT.
[They whisper in the corridor.]

LADY MARY
He's dead. I think he's dead. No, I'm sure he's dead.

ANNA
But how? Wh...

LADY MARY
We were together and...he's dead.

ANNA
In your room?

[Mary nods and tries to hold back her tears.]

ANNA
We've got to get him back to his own bed.

LADY MARY
But how? It's in the bachelor's corridor miles from my room.

ANNA
Well, could we manage it between us?

LADY MARY
He weighs a ton. I can hardly shift him at all. We'll need at least one other. What about Bates?

[Anna shakes her head.]

ANNA
He couldn't lift him. William can't keep a secret, and Thomas wouldn't try to.

LADY MARY
We've got to do something!

ANNA
Then who else has as much to lose as you if it ever gets out?

LADY MARY
Not Papa. Please don't say Papa, I couldn't bear the way he'd look at me.

ANNA
No, not His Lordship.

--
[29:42, INT. LADY MARY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT]
[Cora looks at the body and Mary in shock. They talk in whispers.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
What happened?

LADY MARY
I don't know. A heart attack, I suppose, or a stroke or...he was alive and suddenly he cried out and then he was dead!

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
But...why was he here at all? Did he force himself on you?

[Mary hesitates, then shakes her head.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Well...

[Cora tries to cope with that shock.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
We can talk about that later. Now, we must decide what to do for the best.

ANNA
There's only one thing we can do.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I couldn't. It's not possible.

LADY MARY
If you don't, we will figure in a scandal of such magnitude it will never be forgotten until long after we're both dead. I'll be ruined, Mama! Ruined and notorious, a laughingstock, a social pariah. Is that what you want for your eldest daughter? Is it what you want for the family?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
We must cover him up.

--
[30:45, INT. CORRIDOR - DAWN]
[Mary, Anna, and Cora carry the body in a sheet. They talk in whispers.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Hurry, the servants will be up soon.

ANNA
We've got time.

[Mary stumbles and drops Pamuk's feet.]

LADY MARY
Mama!

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Sorry!

[They shift positions as they reach the guest bedroom door. Mary drops Pamuk's feet again. Daisy sees them in the corridor as they carry the body into the room. She shrinks back into the servants' corridor.]

--
[31:18, INT. GUEST BEDROOM - DAWN]
[The women situate Pamuk under his bed covers and Cora takes the sheet they carried him in. Mary tries to close his eyes, but they keep popping open.]

LADY MARY (weeping)
I can't make his eyes stay shut.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Leave that and come away.

[Anna turns the light out.]

LADY MARY
He was so beautiful.

ANNA
Her Ladyship's right. We must get back to our rooms.

[Mary and Anna walk to Cora at the door.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I feel now that I can never forgive what you have put me through this night. I hope in time I will come to be more merciful, but I doubt it.

[Mary nods.]

LADY MARY
You won't tell Papa?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Since it would probably kill him, and certainly ruin his life, I will not. But I keep this secret for his sake, not for yours.

LADY MARY
Yes, Mama.

[Mary looks down in acceptance and shame. Cora hands the bed sheet to Anna.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Anna, I will not insult you by asking that you also conceal Lady Mary's shame. Let us go.

[They exit and Anna blows out the candle before she closes the door.]

--
[32:32, INT. BACHELOR'S CORRIDOR - MORNING]
[Thomas brings a breakfast tray to Pamuk's room. He knocks before entering and stops short when he sees Pamuk dead in the bed.]

--
[32:52, INT. GREAT HALL - MORNING]
[Napier sees Mary as she descends the stairs.]

EVELYN NAPIER
I imagine you've heard what's happened?

LADY MARY
Yes.

EVELYN NAPIER
Terrible thing. Awful. Ghastly for your parents. I don't suppose I shall ever make it up to them.

LADY MARY
It wasn't your fault.

EVELYN NAPIER
Well, I brought him here. If it isn't my fault, whose is it?

[Mary is clearly uncomfortable. Her eyes are red from crying.]

EVELYN NAPIER
I was wondering if you might show me the gardens before I go. We could get some fresh air.

LADY MARY
I won't, if you'll forgive me. I ought to s--stay and help Mama.

EVELYN NAPIER
Of course.

[Napier nods and turns round to leave, but stops and turns back.]

EVELYN NAPIER
I am so sorry about all this. I've told your father I'll deal with the embassy. There won't be any more annoyance for you.

LADY MARY
Thank you.

EVELYN NAPIER
Actually, he was a terribly nice fellow. I wish I could have known him better.

[Mary begins to cry again.]

EVELYN NAPIER
I took him on as a duty, but I liked him more and more the longer I knew him.

[Mary covers her mouth as she cries.]

EVELYN NAPIER
Perhaps you saw his qualities for yourself.

[Mary goes back upstairs crying.]

EVELYN NAPIER
Which obviously you did.

--
[34:18, INT. SERVANTS' CORRIDOR/KITCHENS - DAY]

WILLIAM
I had an uncle who went like that. Finished his cocoa, closed his book and fell back dead on the pillow.

THOMAS
I don't think Mr Pamuk bothered with cocoa much, or books. He had other interests.

WILLIAM
I meant, you can go just like that.

[William snaps his fingers.]

WILLIAM
With no reason.

GWEN
Well, that's why you should treat every day as if it were your last.

THOMAS
Well, we couldn't criticise Mr Pamuk where that's concerned.

DAISY
What do you mean?

THOMAS
Nothing. Careful with that.

[Daisy stares after Thomas as she absentmindedly stirs a bowl. Anna walks upstairs. Gwen is following when Sybil appears around the corner of the servants' hall with a newspaper in her hands.]

LADY SYBIL
Gwen, are you busy?

GWEN
Your Ladyship?

[Sybil steps back into the servants' hall and Gwen joins her.]

LADY SYBIL
I saw this.

[Sybil shows Gwen the newspaper.]

LADY SYBIL
It came out yesterday, look. It's for a secretary at a new firm in Thirsk. See?

GWEN
But...I don't understand. How did you know?

LADY SYBIL
That you want to leave? Carson told my father.

GWEN
And you don't mind?

LADY SYBIL
Why should I? I think it's terrific that people make their own lives, especially women. Write to them today and name me as your reference. I can give it without ever specifying precisely what your work here has been.

[Sybil turns to leave.]

GWEN
Milady...thank you.

[Sybil nods with a smile and leaves.]

--
[35:31, EXT. DOWNTON ABBEY, GROUNDS - DAY]
[Napier walks towards Cora who is strolling around the grounds.]

EVELYN NAPIER
Lady Grantham! I've come to say goodbye. They're bringing the car around to take me to the station.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Have you said goodbye to Mary?

EVELYN NAPIER
I have.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Will we be seeing you here again?

EVELYN NAPIER
Nothing would give me more pleasure, but I'm afraid I'm a little busy at the moment, and...I wonder if I might risk embarrassing you, because I should like to make myself clear. The truth is, Lady Grantham, I'm not a vain man. I do not consider myself a very interesting person, but I feel it's important that my future wife should think me so. A woman who finds me boring could never love me, and I believe marriage should be based on love. (chuckles) At least at the start.

[Cora smiles.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Thank you for your faith in me, Mr Napier. Your instincts do you credit. Good luck to you.

[They shake hands.]

--
[36:32, INT. LIBRARY - DAY]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Did Mr Napier get off all right?

MR CARSON
He did, my lord.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
And poor Mr Pamuk has been taken care of?

MR CARSON
We got Grasby's from Thirsk in the end. They're very good and they didn't mind coming out on a Sunday.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Is everyone all right downstairs?

MR CARSON
Well, you know. He was a handsome stranger from foreign parts one minute, and the next he was as dead as a doornail. It's bound to be a shock.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Of course. Upstairs or down. It's been horrid for the ladies, and for the female staff, I expect.

MR CARSON
It's particularly hard on the younger maids.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Indeed. Don't let the footmen be too coarse in front of them. Thomas likes to show off, but we must have a care for feminine sensibilities. They are finer and more fragile than our own.

[Mr Carson nods.]

[BREAK 2]

--
ACT THREE
[37:29, INT. SERVANTS' CORRIDOR - DAY]
[Mrs Hughes finds Mr Bates cringing over his leg again.]

MRS HUGHES
Mr Bates?

[Bates straightens and pretends nothing is wrong.]

MRS HUGHES
I am going to have to insist that you tell me what is the matter.

MR BATES
I thought it was for Mr Carson to give me orders.

MRS HUGHES
Mr Carson's no better than any other man when it comes to illness. Now, tell me what it is and I'll see what I can do.

MR BATES
It's nothing, truly. I've twisted my bad leg and walked on it too soon. It'll be fine in a day or two.

MRS HUGHES
Well, if it isn't, I'm sending for the doctor.

--
[38:05, INT. DRAWING ROOM - DAY]
[Mary is entranced in her own gloomy thoughts. Carson enters to introduce Violet.]

MR CARSON
The Dowager Countess.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Oh, my dears, is it really true? I--I can't believe it. Last night he looked so well. Of course, it would happen to a foreigner. It's typical.

LADY MARY
Don't be ridiculous.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I'm not being ridiculous. No Englishman would dream of dying in someone else's house. Especially someone they didn't even know.

LADY SYBIL
Oh, Granny, even the English aren't in control of everything.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Well, I hope we're in control of something, if only ourselves.

LADY MARY
But we're not! Don't you see that? We're not in control of anything at all!

[Mary leaves quickly.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Edith, go and tell Mary to come back at once and apologise to her grandmother.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
No, leave her alone. She's had a shock, we all have. Just let her rest.

[Carson opens the door and William carries in the tea.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Oh, just the ticket. Nanny always said, "Sweet tea is the thing for frayed nerves." Though why it has to be sweet, I couldn't tell you.

--
[39:09, INT. KITCHENS - DAY]

GWEN
What did you mean, "Mr Pamuk lived each day as if it were his last"?

THOMAS
What I said.

GWEN
But, well, how did you know?

THOMAS
Can't keep William waiting. Gangway.

MISS O'BRIEN
I'll be asking the same question later, so you better have an answer ready.

[Thomas leaves with a smirk.]

MRS PATMORE
Daisy, where have you hidden the flour? I can't see it anywhere.

DAISY
It's just there, Mrs Patmore.

MRS PATMORE
Well, fetch it to me, then. Oh, you're all in a daze today.

--
[39:39, INT. CRAWLEY HOUSE - DAY]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Do you think we should've gone up there? To see how they are?

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
I sent a note, but I thought I'd be in the way. Why?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Well, I thought Mary was rather struck with him last night, didn't you?

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Well, it must've been frightful for all of them. But there it is. In the midst of life, we are in death.

--
[40:03, INT. LADY GRANTHAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT]

MISS O'BRIEN
I suppose Mr Napier will have to manage everything.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I suppose he will.

MISS O'BRIEN
We all thought him a very nice gentleman.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Yes, he is nice.

MISS O'BRIEN
Will we be seeing a lot of him?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I don't expect so, no.

MISS O'BRIEN
Because we rather hope Lady Mary might have taken a shine to him.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Seems not.

MISS O'BRIEN
Oh, well. There are plenty more fish in the sea than ever came out of it.

--
[40:32, INT. BACHELOR'S CORRIDOR/GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT]
[Carson enters to check the room. Mary is sitting on a chair in a corner.]

LADY MARY
Are you looking for something?

[Carson is startled.]

MR CARSON
Lady Mary?

[Mary stands.]

MR CARSON
I just wanted to make sure the room had been tidied up after the...after the people had left.

LADY MARY
Life can be terribly unfair, can't it?

MR CARSON
It certainly can.

LADY MARY
Everything seems so golden one minute, then turns to ashes the next. Can I ask you a question, Carson? Have you ever felt your life was somehow...slipping away? And there was nothing you could do to stop it?

MR CARSON
I think everyone feels that at one time or another.

LADY MARY
The odd thing is, I feel...for the first time, really...I understand what it is to be happy. It's just that I know that I won't be.

MR CARSON
Don't say that, my lady. Don't raise the white flag quite yet. You will still be mistress of Downton. Old Lady Grantham hasn't given up the fight, not by a long shot.

LADY MARY
Oh, that. I wasn't even thinking about that.

MR CARSON
And if I may say so, my lady, you're still very young.

LADY MARY
Am I? I don't feel it.

MR CARSON
We're all behind you, my lady. The staff. We're all on your side.

[Mary smiles.]

LADY MARY
Thank you, Carson. You've always been so kind to me. Always. From when I was quite a little girl. Why is that?

MR CARSON
Even a butler has his favourites, my lady.

[Mary smiles.]

LADY MARY
Does he? I'm glad.

ANNA
Lady Mary?

[Mary stands and dries her eyes.]

ANNA
Oh, milady, I thought--

[Anna sees Carson.]

LADY MARY
Carson and I were just making sure that everything was shipshape in Bristol fashion. And it is.

[Mary walks to the door and Anna exits.]

LADY MARY
Goodnight, Carson.

MR CARSON
Goodnight, my lady.

[They exit.]

--
[43:06, INT. LORD GRANTHAM'S DRESSING ROOM - MORNING]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Of all the men on earth. I mean, he looked so fit. Dr Clarkson said it was a heart attack. Did you see any signs?

MR BATES
I didn't have much of a chance to study the gentleman.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You don't suppose there's anything sinister in it, do you? Every day the papers warn us of German spies, and they did say his presence was essential for peace in Albania.

MR BATES
I doubt it, my lord. Anyone wanting to poison his food would have to get past Mrs Patmore.

[Robert chuckles.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Blimey, that's a thought. Unless, of course, she's a spy herself.

[Bates cringes in pain. Robert is concerned.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I wish you'd tell me what's wrong, Bates. You'll be in no trouble. I only want to help.

MR BATES
I know that, Your Lordship, and I am grateful, truly, but there is nothing I need help with.

[Robert nods and lets it go.]

--
[43:51, INT. CORRIDOR - MORNING]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Good morning, Mrs Hughes.

MRS HUGHES
Good morning, milord.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I wonder if you...

[Robert looks back at his room where he left Bates.]

--
[44:00, INT. LORD GRANTHAM'S DRESSING ROOM - MORNING]
[Bates leans on the bed frame, doubled over in pain. Mrs Hughes enters and Bates straightens.]

MRS HUGHES
Now, will you kindly explain what in heaven is going on?

MR BATES
I'm perfectly well, Mrs Hughes. A bit stiff, that's all.

[Mr Bates begins to limp towards the door, but Mrs Hughes closes it.]

MRS HUGHES
Just so long as you know, I'm not leaving until you tell me.

[Mr Bates sits in a chair and Mrs Hughes turns to him expectantly.]

MR BATES
I hope you have a strong stomach.

[Mr Bates pulls up his pant leg, revealing severe bruising, bleeding, and swelling caused by the limp corrector. Mrs Hughes grimaces.]

MRS HUGHES
Oh, my God.

[Mrs Hughes puts a hand to her mouth in horror.]

--
[44:58, EXT. DOWNTON ABBEY, GROUNDS - DAY]
[Matthew walks away from the house to join Mary.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Cousin Mary?

LADY MARY
Hello. Are we expecting you?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
No, but I wanted to see you. I looked for you yesterday at church.

LADY MARY
I wasn't feeling up to it. None of us were.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Must have been a horrible shock.

LADY MARY
Yes.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
And he seemed a nice fellow.

LADY MARY
He was. A very nice fellow.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
So, if there's anything I can do...please ask.

LADY MARY
There isn't. But thank you.

--
[45:42, EXT. DOWNTON ABBEY, LAKE - DAY]
[Mrs Hughes precedes Mr Bates down the dock to the lake. Mrs Hughes uncovers the limp corrector she's carrying and hands it to Bates.]

MR BATES
Well, here goes.

MRS HUGHES
Do you not think we ought to say a few words?

MR BATES
What? Good riddance?

MRS HUGHES
That. And your promise.

MR BATES
Very well. I promise I will never again try to cure myself. I will spend my life happily as the butt of other's jokes, and I will never mind them.

MRS HUGHES
We all carry scars, Mr Bates, inside or out. You're no different to the rest of us, remember that.

MR BATES
I will try to. That I do promise.

[Mrs Hughes nods and Bates throws the "limp corrector" into the lake.]

MRS HUGHES
Good riddance!

--
[46:36, EXT. COURTYARD - DAY]

MISS O'BRIEN
So, he definitely went in?

THOMAS
Saw him walk through the door.

MISS O'BRIEN
But you don't know if he went back to his own room?

THOMAS
Yes, I do, 'cause I was the one who found him there the next day.

MISS O'BRIEN
What I mean is, you don't know if he went back under his own steam.

THOMAS
Suppose not, but how else would he a done it?

MISS O'BRIEN
That's what they call "the big question".

THOMAS
I don't want to get in any trouble over this.

MISS O'BRIEN
Don't worry. You won't. Your secret's safe with me.
