SERVANT
A letter for you, William.

--
[00:50, INT. LIBRARY - MORNING]
[Mrs Hughes brings some flowers into the library and sees Mr Carson feeding the fireplace.]

MRS HUGHES
Why on earth are you doing that?

MR CARSON
Someone's got to.

MRS HUGHES
Yes, indeed, they do. And that someone is William or one of the maids. You're making work for yourself, Mr Carson, and I've no sympathy with that.

MR CARSON
I'm not asking for sympathy.

--
[01:07, INT. LORD GRANTHAM'S DRESSING ROOM - MORNING]

MR LANG
I don't think y-you should be in--

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
What? Oh, for heaven's sake, man! If something's wrong, put it right!

[Lang fixes Robert's uniform.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I'm sorry Lang, I don't mean to snap.

MR LANG
Nothing to worry about, my lord.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM (sigh)
You've been in the trenches, I have not. I've no right to criticise.

MR LANG
I'm not a soldier now.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You've been invalided out. That is perfectly honourable.

MR LANG
Is it? I know people look at me and wonder why I'm not in uniform.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Then you refer them to me and I'll give them a piece of my mind. Hmm?

[They nod to each other.]

--
[01:43, INT. KITCHENS - MORNING]
[Mrs Patmore reads a letter at a table, distressed. Daisy enters.]

DAISY
Penny for your thoughts.

MRS PATMORE
They're worth a great deal more than that, thank you very much.

[William enters with his letter.]

DAISY
What is it?

WILLIAM
My papers. They've come. I've been called up.

MRS PATMORE
Oh. You never have.

DAISY
What does it mean?

WILLIAM
I'm to report for my medical next Wednesday, and once I'm through that, I go to Richmond for training.

DAISY
And then you...go to war?

WILLIAM
Will any luck. I'll be beggared if it's over before I get there.

MRS PATMORE
Well, if they'd listen to me, it'd be over by tea time.

WILLIAM
Daisy, I wonder, would you give me a picture to take with me?

DAISY
I haven't got one.

WILLIAM
Well, then have one taken on your afternoon off, please.

MRS PATMORE
That's enough. Let her get on with her work.

--
[02:23, INT. LADY GRANTHAM'S BEDROOM - MORNING]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
How's Thomas coming along? I wish he could be treated at our hospital here.

O'BRIEN
Well, it's only for officers.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Of course.

O'BRIEN
Although, ideally, he'd love to be transferred there to work.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
He won't be sent back to the front?

O'BRIEN
Not with his hand the way it is.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
It's such a pity he isn't under Dr Clarkson. We might have been able to influence him a bit.

O'BRIEN
I should hope so. Why, without this family and all the money you've spent, his precious hospital wouldn't exist at all.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Perhaps I'll ask his advice, you never know.

O'BRIEN
I was sure you'd have a good idea of what to do for the best.

--
[02:58, INT. BATTLEFRONT TRENCHES - MORNING]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Fancy a tour in England, Davis?

DAVIS
I assume you're [?] me on, sir.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Not at all. General Sir Herbert Strutt has asked for my transfer to be his ADC. He's touring England to boost recruitment and he's remembered that I know Manchester and Yorkshire pretty well. It'll mean a couple of months at home and a promotion to captain. I can't object to that.

--
[03:23, INT. LIBRARY - MORNING]

WILLIAM
I've only got a few days before the medical, milady.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Go and tell your father.

[William nods.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
You don't mind, do you, Carson?

MR CARSON
We must manage with no footman at all from next Wednesday. It'll be no different if we start now.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
And you've always got Lang.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
We wish you every good fortune. Don't we, darling?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
We certainly do.

[Robert reaches to shake William's hand.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Good luck, William.

WILLIAM
Thank you, milord.

[Mr Carson and William exit.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
So, both my footmen have gone to the war while I cut ribbons and make speeches.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
And keep people's spirits up, which is very important.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
By God, I envy them, though. I envy their self-respect, and I envy their ability to sleep at night.

--
[04:14, INT. KITCHENS - DAY]

O'BRIEN
Mr Carson doesn't like the smell of cleaning materials in the servants' hall, not just before luncheon.

ETHEL
Go on, Miss O'Brien, we don't want to be unfriendly, do we?

O'BRIEN
You obviously don't.

[O'Brien sees Lang's fingers shaking as he struggles to put the cap on the cleaner bottle.]

O'BRIEN
Nevermind. Finish it now you're started, but don't blame me if Mr Carson takes a bite out of you.

[Lang puts the bottle back on the table. Mr Molesley clears his throat as he enters.]

MR MOLESLEY
Hello, Mr Lang. Everything all right?

MR LANG
Why do you say that?

MR MOLESLEY
No reason. I only meant I hope you're enjoying yourself. I know I would be in your shoes.

O'BRIEN
You never tried for the job, did you?

MR MOLESLEY
I never got the chance. I no sooner heard that Mr Bates was gone when he arrived.

[Molesley laughs, but no on joins in.]

O'BRIEN
What brings you here, Mr Molesley?

MR MOLESLEY
I was wondering if Anna was anywhere around.

ETHEL
I could find her if you like.

MR MOLESLEY
Oh, no. Just give her this.

[He holds out a book and puts it on the table.]

MR MOLESLEY
We were talking about it the other day. I came across a copy in Ripon.

[Molesley leaves and Ethel picks up the book to read the title.]

ETHEL
Elizabeth and Her German Garden. Whatever's that about?

O'BRIEN
It's about an invitation to talk some more, that's what.

--
[05:26, EXT. DOWNTON COTTAGE HOSPITAL - DAY]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Goodbye, Dr Clarkson.

[Cora starts walking away.]

DR CLARKSON
Lady Grantham.

[She stops and Clarkson walks out to her.]

DR CLARKSON
I'd love to help, but it's not within my power to hook men from hither and thither as I please.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
It's not at all what I was asking.

DR CLARKSON
Forgive me, but I thought you were saying that you wanted Corporal Barrow to come and work here when he's fully recovered.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I think it a credit to him that he wants to continue to serve in this way. After he's been wounded.

DR CLARKSON
Well, that it may be, but it's not for me to decide what happens next.

[Cora nods disappointedly and leaves.]

--
[06:06, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - DAY]
[Mr Carson struggles to open a bottle of wine. He has to stop to take a breath.]

ANNA
Mr Carson, are you quite well?

MR CARSON
Oh, leave me alone.

[He struggles some more and pulls the cork out of the bottle.]

--
[INT. DINING ROOM - DAY]
[Mr Carson serves the family luncheon.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
But after twenty-four hours, it just doesn't do it.

[Carson bumps into Violet's chair.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Are you all right, Carson?

MR CARSON
Of course. That is, er, perfectly all right, Your Ladyship, thank you.

[Mr Carson goes to pour Robert a glass, but he holds up his hand.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Er, no.

LADY EDITH
Cousin Isobel says Matthew's coming home in a fortnight. He's touring England with some general.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
We'll have a dinner when he's here.

[Mr Carson stops to look at Robert. He's not pleased.]

LADY MARY
I was going to ask Richard Carlisle about then. For Saturday to Monday.

[Carson takes a breath at the thought of another dinner.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
You be careful, Mary. Sir Richard Mustn't think you're after him.

LADY SYBIL
Isn't that the truth?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
The truth is neither here nor there. It's the look of the thing that matters. Ask Rosamund. It'll take the edge off it.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Well, that'd be nice. Like before the war.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
How can we manage a great pre-war house party without a single footman?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
My dear, Rosamund is not a house party. She's blood.

LADY EDITH
I saw Mrs Drake when I went into the village. The wife of John Drake, who has Long Field Farm.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Yes. What did she have to say?

LADY EDITH
Apparently their final able-bodied farmhand has been called up. They need a man to drive the tractor.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Well, hasn't Drake recovered from his illness? I thought he was better.

LADY EDITH
No, he is. He's much, much better. But he doesn't drive. So I told her I could do it.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
What?

LADY EDITH
I said I could drive the tractor.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Edith! You are a lady, not Toad of Toad Hall.

LADY EDITH
Well, I'm doing it.

[Mary and Robert smile at her determination.]

--
[07:46, EXT. LONG FIELD FARM - DAY]
[Edith cycles to the farm.]

LADY EDITH
Don't look so bewildered. It's simple. I will drive the tractor.

MRS DRAKE
Well, can you do that?

LADY EDITH
Absolutely. Can you hitch up the plough or whatever it is I'm dragging?

JOHN DRAKE
Of course.

LADY EDITH
When would you like me to start?

MRS DRAKE (laughs in shock)
Well, I better get you something to wear, then.

--
[08:16, INT. KITCHENS - DAY]

ANNA
Oh, I like a bit of life in a house, but I-- I just hope Mr Carson doesn't spontaneously combust.

MRS PATMORE
Erm, I had a letter yesterday.

ANNA
Yes?

MRS PATMORE
It's my sister's boy. He's--he's with the Lancashire Fusiliers, only he's gone missing.

[Mrs Patmore puts on her glasses and pulls out the note.]

MRS PATMORE
Erm, "missing presumed dead" they call it.

ANNA
Oh, no. How did it happen?

MRS PATMORE
Well, that's just it. They can't find out how it happened, why it happened, whether we can be sure it did happen or he isn't lying prisoner somewhere.

ANNA
Why not ask His Lordship? He'll have friends in the war office. They can dig something up

MRS PATMORE
Oh, well n-- I don't like to bother him.

ANNA
Why not? He's got broad shoulders.

MRS PATMORE
Oh.

--
[08:59, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - DAY]
[Ethel watches Lang mend a jacket.]

ETHEL
Oh, it's ever so fine, Mr Lang. However can you make those big hands do such delicate work? I expect there's no end to the things they could manage.

O'BRIEN
Giving you a slap for a start.

[Ethel pulls back and pouts.]

O'BRIEN
That is good. Very good. I like to see a proper skill. These days, blokes think they can be a valet if they can smile and tie a shoelace, but there's an art to it, and I can tell you've got it.

MR LANG
My mother taught me. She was a lady's maid like you.

O'BRIEN
Well, she knew what she was about.

MR CARSON
Oh, Mr Lang.

[Lang stands hurriedly.]

MR CARSON
As you know, Sir Richard Carlisle arrives later and the Crawleys are coming for dinner tonight. I really can't have maids in the dining room for such a party, so I'd be grateful if you'd help me and play the footman.

MR LANG
Me? Wait a table?

MR CARSON
Oh, it's not ideal, but I'm afraid I've no choice. The footman's liveries are in a cupboard just past Mrs Hughes's sitting room. You should find one to fit you.

--
[10:06, INT. LIBRARY - DAY]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I'm not sure what I can do, but I'm happy to try. What's his name?

MRS PATMORE
Archie. That is, Archibald Philpots. He was in the Lancashire Fusiliers. They think he was in northern France.

[Robert writes it down.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You realise the most likely outcome is that he has, indeed, been killed?

MRS PATMORE
I understand, milord. But we'd rather know the worst than wonder.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Mm.

--
[10:30, INT. SERVANTS' HALL]
[Anna walks down the corridor and Molesley enters.]

MR MOLESLEY
Ah.

ANNA
Oh. Hello, Mr Molesley. What are you doing here?

MR MOLESLEY
I asked inside and they said you were over in the laundry.

ANNA
Lady Mary wants to wear this tonight. I wasn't sure it was done.

MR MOLESLEY
I was really wondering if you'd had a chance to read that book.

ANNA
You only gave it to me yesterday.

MR MOLESLEY
Of course, of course. But, when you have read it, I hope we can exchange our views.

ANNA
That'd be nice. But perhaps we might bring some of the others in. We could have a sort of reading club.

MR MOLESLEY
We could do that. Er...or we talk about it together, just we two.

[Miss O'Brien walks by.]

ANNA
Heavens, it's later than I thought. I must get on.

--
[11:19, INT. LADY GRANTHAM'S BEDROOM - DAY]
[O'Brien fixes Cora's hair. Robert enters.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I'm off to change, but I wanted you to know I sent a note down to Clarkson, which should do the trick.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
What did you say?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Only that I gathered you'd asked a favour and, given that the estate shoulders the hospital costs, it did seem a little unfair if we weren't allowed a few perks.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Quite right. Thank you, darling.

[Robert smiles at her and exits.]

O'BRIEN
Well done, my lady.

--
[11:45, EXT. LONG FIELD FARM - DAY]
[John Drake hitches the tractor to a tree stump while Edith sits in the driver's seat]

LADY EDITH
Ready?

JOHN DRAKE
Ready!

[Edith has trouble with the clutch.]

LADY EDITH
Come on, damn you.

[Edith changes gears and moves the tractor forward. It pulls the tree out by the roots. Drake cheers. Later, they drink in the barn.]

JOHN DRAKE
To the victor the spoils.

[They toast.]

LADY EDITH
Did you plant that tree?

JOHN DRAKE
Steady on. It must be forty years old.

[They chuckle.]

LADY EDITH
It's not a flattering light.

JOHN DRAKE
My father planted it. But you have to be tough with free trees, not let them outstay their welcome.

LADY EDITH
Farming needs a kind of toughness, doesn't it? There's room for sentiment, but not sentimentality.

JOHN DRAKE
Beautifully put, if I may say so, my lady.

[Edith smiles at the compliment.]

JOHN DRAKE
You should be a writer.

LADY EDITH
Thank you.

[Mrs Drake comes in with a basket.]

MRS DRAKE
How you getting on?

JOHN DRAKE
Very well, I think.

MRS DRAKE
And it's not too hard for you?

LADY EDITH
Not at all.

JOHN DRAKE
She's stronger than she looks.

MRS DRAKE
I brought you something to eat, my lady. Though, I'm afraid it's not what you're used to.

[The dog sniffs at the basket.]

MRS DRAKE
Hey, it's not for you.

[BREAK 1]

--
[13:01, EXT. COURTYARD - DAY]
[Thomas walks to Downton. O'Brien meets him in the courtyard as he smokes.]

O'BRIEN
So it is you. Ethel thought I must have a soldier fancy man.

THOMAS
She the new maid?

O'BRIEN
Yes. She's a soppy sort. So, tell me, was Dr Clarkson thrilled to have your services?

THOMAS
It's Major Clarkson now, but yes. I don't know how you did it.

[O'Brien smiles.]

O'BRIEN
What about your blighty?

[She nods to his hand. He pulls off the glove, showing how it was maimed by the bullet.]

O'BRIEN
My god.

THOMAS
It's not so bad. And it lived up to its name and got me home.

O'BRIEN
You better come inside.

--
[13:56, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - DAY]

THOMAS
Where's William?

DAISY
Training for the army.

THOMAS
I thought he might've died for love of you.

DAISY
Don't be nasty, not as soon as you're back.

THOMAS
Imagine Carson without a footman. Like a ringmaster without a pony.

MRS HUGHES
We'll have none of your cheek, thank you, Thomas.

THOMAS
I'm very sorry, Mrs Hughes, but I'm not a servant anymore. I take my orders from Major Clarkson. Who's this.

O'BRIEN
Ethel, the new maid I told you.

ETHEL
When I saw you out there I didn't realise I was dealing with an ex-footman.

THOMAS
I'm the one that got away.

ETHEL
Gives hope to us all.

[Carson enters.]

MR CARSON
Ethel? Get ready to help with the luggage, they're nearly back with Sir Richard.

O'BRIEN
We've got a visitor, Mr Carson.

MR CARSON
I've seen him.

[Carson never bothers to look at Thomas and exits.]

THOMAS
Where's Mr Bates?

O'BRIEN
Gone. Replaced by Mr Lang.

THOMAS
So not all the changes were bad.

[Anna ignores him and continues her sewing.]

--
[14:48, EXT. DOWNTON - DAY]
[Branson drives the car up to the front door and Sir Richard Carlisle gets out and greets Cora.]

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
Hello.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
We're so pleased to have you here, Sir Richard.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
Lady Grantham.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Welcome.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
Thank you.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I hope the train wasn't too tiring.

LADY ROSAMUND
Hello, Mary.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
Not a bit. No, I got a lot done.

LADY MARY
Hello Aunt Rosamund.

LADY ROSAMUND
Brother, dear.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
How are you?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Lovely to see you Rosamund.

[The family goes inside while Branson talks with Sir Richard's servants.]

LADY MARY
He's nice, isn't he?

LADY ROSAMUND
To be honest, he spent the entire journey reading his own papers. But I'm sure I'll love him dearly if he'll ever look up from a page.

[Rosamund and Mary enter the house. Cora comes out for a moment.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Branson, when you've finished unloading, run down to the hospital and remind Lady Sybil that we expect her here for dinner. And tell her I mean it. Really. They're working her like a pack horse in a mine.

[Cora turns to go.]

BRANSON
I think she enjoys it, though.

[Cora stops and turns around to put him in his place.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Please tell her to come home in time to change.

[Branson nods grimly and returns to the car.]

--
[16:02, INT. DOWNTON COTTAGE HOSPITAL - DAY]

LADY SYBIL
I can't possibly come! Really, Mama is incorrigible!

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
It's not poor Branson's fault.

LADY SYBIL
But what is the point of Mama's soirees? What are they for?

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Well, I'm going out for dinner tonight and I'm glad. Is that wrong?

[Thomas walks in with some blankets.]

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Thomas, you can cover for Nurse Crawley, can't you?

THOMAS
I can.

[Thomas starts making up a bed and Branson approaches him.]

BRANSON
So you're back, then. Safe and sound.

THOMAS
That's not how I'd put it with my hand the way it is, but yes. Major Clarkson's found me a place and I'm grateful.

LADY SYBIL
Can you give Lieutenant Courtenay his pills?

THOMAS
Of course I can. I'd be glad to.

[We see Lt. Courtenay sitting in a bed with his eyes covered in bandages.]


--
[16:47, INT. MRS HUGHES'S SITTING ROOM - EVENING]

MRS HUGHES
Is everything under control?

ANNA
Mr Lang seems a bit nervous.

[Mrs Hughes dismisses it with a wave.]

MRS HUGHES
Stage fright. But what about you?

ANNA
Oh. I'm a trooper. And we can't complain, can we? Not when you think what's going on in France.

MRS HUGHES
Still. A broken heart can be as painful as a broken limb.

ANNA
Don't feel sorry for me, Mrs Hughes. I'm not. I know what real love is and there aren't many who can say that. I'm one of the lucky ones.

MRS HUGHES
If you say so.

--
[17:29, INT. DRAWING ROOM - EVENING]

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
So the fashion for cocktails before dinner hasn't reached Yorkshire?

LADY MARY
I could get Carson to make you one, but I won't guarantee the result.

MR CARSON
Mrs Crawley, Captain Crawley, and Miss Swire.

[Mr Carson steps aside for them to enter.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Ah. Isobel.

[Matthew steps forward.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Well, now. Still in one piece. Thank God.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Touch wood.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I never stop touching it.

LADY MARY
Do you know Sir Richard Carlisle? My cousin, Captain Crawley.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
How do you do?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
And his fiancé, Miss Swire.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
I know Miss Swire. Her uncle and I are old friends.

LAVINIA
Well, old acquaintances, anyway.

[Across the room, Sybil speaks with her aunt.]

LADY SYBIL
What do you think Mary sees in him?

LADY ROSAMUND
Besides the money, you mean?

LADY SYBIL
It must be more than that.

LADY ROSAMUND
For you. Not necessarily for her.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
What is General Strutt like?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Well, you know. Rather important. And brave. He got the [?] in Africa.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Is there any chance it might be permanent? That we can count you out of danger? It would be such a relief.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I wouldn't want that, I'm afraid. He's promised to get me back to France when he's done with me. How's your new appointment with the North Ridings working out?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Oh, that. It seems I won't be going to the front after all. I made a mistake. They only wanted a mascot.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Mary tells me you're in newspapers?

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
Well, I own a few.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Ah. That must be quite a responsibility at a time like this, you know, in a war. When it's so important to keep people's spirits up.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
Lady Grantham, my responsibility is to investors. I need to keep my readership up. I leave the public spirits to government propaganda.

[Mary approaches.]

LADY MARY
So now you've met Granny. I warn you, she has very strong opinions.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Oh, you need have no fear where that's concerned, my dear. We're more than evenly matched.

--
[19:19, INT. KITCHENS - EVENING]

MR CARSON
Where are the spoons for this?

DAISY
Just here.

[Daisy hands them to Carson.]

MR CARSON
Oh my God, I've forgotten the sauce.

ANNA
Mr Lang's bringing the sauce, and the Melba toast.

MR CARSON
Right. Right. Good.

ANNA
Now, Mr Lang, are you ready?

MR LANG
I think so. Now, it's always the left, and not ladies first?

ANNA
No. Just follow Mr Carson. Start with Old Lady Grantham, then His Lordship, then just go on round. You must have done this before.

MR LANG
Not since the war started.

DAISY
I don't think I ever knew that. Why i'n't it just ladies first? Wouldn't it be more polite?

ANNA
That's the way it's done on the continent, and we don't like foreign ways here.

[19:50, INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I gather your footman Thomas has returned to the village. No.

[Violet refuses the sauce Lang offers.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Crikey. Where did you see him?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
At the hospital. Seems he's working there.

[Lang walks around Carson, past Robert to serve Lady Rosamund.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I wonder how he wangled that.

MR CARSON (whisper to Lang)
Get back behind me!

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE (background)
Not as well as I should.

[Carson and Lang switch places and Lang serves Robert the sauce. Robert and Rosamund speak in low tones to avoid being overheard.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
What do you make of our [?]?

LADY ROSAMUND
He's an opportunity. Mary needs a position, and preferably a powerful one. He can provide it.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You don't think she'd be happier with a more traditional set up?

LADY ROSAMUND
Will she have the option?

[Lang continues down the table to Rosamund.]

LADY ROSAMUND
Thank you, but I already have some.

MR CARSON
No, no. Give that to me.

[Lang tries to hand Carson the sauce, but Carson drops it and it spills all over Edith.]

MR CARSON
I--I do apologise, my lady. I-- Mr Lang, get a c--

[Mr Carson seizes up.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Carson?

[The entire table stands up to help Carson.]

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Carson, what's the matter?

LADY MARY
Carson, it's all right. Everything will be fine.

[Isobel sits Carson down in her chair.]

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Edith, go with Branson and fetch Major Clarkson. I'll telephone and explain what's happened.

LADY EDITH
What about my dress?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Edith! We'll get you a coat! Come.

LADY MARY
Sybil will know what to do until the doctor comes.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
You'll find there's never a dull moment in this house.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Lady Sybil and I will take him upstairs. Mrs Hughes will show us the way, please.

LADY MARY
I can help.

LADY SYBIL
No, let me. I know what I'm doing.

[Still rather incapacitated, Carson still protests.]

MR CARSON
I'm sure that's not necessary, my lady.

LADY SYBIL
It's not milady now, Carson.

MRS HUGHES (whisper)
Mr Lang!

LADY SYBIL
It's Nurse Crawley.

MRS HUGHES (whisper)
Mr Lang! Come on.

[Mrs Hughes leads him to the doorway where the maids are standing.]

MRS HUGHES (whisper)
Anna and Ethel, I must trust the dinner to you.

ETHEL
Well, I'd say the first course is a thing of the past.

MRS HUGHES (whisper)
Then clear and lay the hot plates. Daisy, you fetch the beef and the rest of it, and Anna, you'll have to serve the wine.

[The girls take off.]

MRS HUGHES (whisper)
Mr Lang, you can clear up the mess.

O'BRIEN
I'll do that.

MRS HUGHES (whisper)
There's no need.

O'BRIEN
I don't mind.

MRS HUGHES (whisper)
I thank you. Mr Lang, you better go downstairs.

--
[21:40, INT. LADY GRANTHAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Well...Clarkson's seen him. It's definitely not a heart attack, but he does need rest.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
He's working much too hard. For a start, he's just got to let the maids serve in the dining room.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Quite right. There is a war. Even Carson has to make sacrifices.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Poor Lang. He looked like a rabbit in front of a snake.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I don't understand it. He seemed so solid when I met him, even taciturn. Now he's a bundle of nerves.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I heard what you said to Matthew about the regiment.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Everyone else knows what a fool I made of myself, why shouldn't he?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I don't think you're a fool. Isn't that enough?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
No. Maybe it should be, but it isn't.

[22:26, INT. VALET'S BEDROOM - NIGHT]
[Lang stands in his room, eyes closed, bombs and gunfire echoing in his mind.]

O'BRIEN
You all right, Mr Lang?

[Lang is startled out of his trance.]

O'BRIEN
You're not, are you? I've seen shellshock before, you know. I had a brother with it. My favourite brother, as it happens. And I was his favourite, too. They sent him back and he's dead now.

MR LANG
They won't send me back. I'm a gonner as far as they're concerned.

O'BRIEN
You shouldn't be working yet.

MR LANG
I must work. I don't know what to do, else. I have to work.

MRS HUGHES
Mr Lang, I thought you'd gone up.

O'BRIEN
He wanted to hang up the livery before it got creased.

MRS HUGHES
We can discuss the dinner another time. I'll say goodnight.

O'BRIEN
Goodnight, Mrs Hughes.

MR LANG
Goodnight.

[23:45, INT. SERVANTS' BEDROOM CORRIDOR - NIGHT]
[Mary knocks on Mr Carson's door, then opens it.]

LADY MARY
May I come in?

[Carson struggles to sit up in bed.]

MR CARSON
How very kind of you, my lady, but do you think you should?

LADY MARY
Let's hope my reputation will survive it. And rest easy, please.

[Mary sits in the chair near the bed.]

LADY MARY
I gather it isn't too serious?

MR CARSON
Agh, I've been very stupid, my lady. I let myself get flustered. I regard that as highly unprofessional. It won't happen again.

LADY MARY
You mustn't be too hard on yourself.

MR CARSON
I was particularly sorry to spoil things for Sir Richard, knowing he was a guest of yours.

LADY MARY
Don't be. I think he found it all quite exciting.

MR CARSON
Will we be seeing a lot of him?

LADY MARY
I don't know. (shrugs) Maybe.

MR CARSON
And Captain Crawley. Is he happy with the changes, so to speak?

[Mary looks down and Carson reads her feelings.]

MR CARSON
May I give you one piece of advice, my lady? Tell him what's in your heart. If you still love him, let him know. Then even if he's killed - and he may be - you won't be sorry. But if you don't tell him, you could regret it all your life long.

LADY MARY
And what about Miss Swire?

MR CARSON (scoffs)
Miss Swire. As if any man in his right mind could prefer Miss Swire to you.

[Mary smiles and Mrs Hughes enters.]

MRS HUGHES
Oh, I'm so sorry, milady. I didn't know you were in here.

LADY MARY
I was just going. Carson's been boosting my confidence.

[Carson smiles affectionately at her and she leaves.]

MRS HUGHES
That's something I'd never have thought she was short of.

--
[25:46, INT. DOWNTON COTTAGE HOSPITAL - NIGHT]
[Thomas sits on the bed next to the blinded Courtenay.]

THOMAS
What about you, sir? What did you do before the war started?

LT. COURTENAY
I was up at Oxford. But I only ever planned to farm. Farm. And shoot. And hunt. And fish. And everything I'll never do again.

THOMAS
You don't know that, sir. We've had cases of gas-blindness wearing off.

LT. COURTENAY
Rare cases, and much sooner than this. It doesn't help me to be lied to, you know. I'm finished. And I'd rather face it than dodge it.

THOMAS
I better go.

--
[26:32, EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY]
[Robert and Cora, and Mary and Sir Richard walk through woods and fields.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Where's Rosamund?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
She's with your Mama, trying to talk her into the idea of Sir Richard.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
You don't sound very enthusiastic.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Are you?

[A few paces behind.]

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
Can we stop for a minute?

LADY MARY
Don't tell me you're tired.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
I'm not tired, I'm hot. This tweed is too thick.

LADY MARY
It looks more suited to shooting than walking.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
I had it made for the weekend. I didn't know there was a difference.

LADY MARY
It doesn't matter.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
That's like the rich who say money doesn't matter. It matters enough when you haven't got it.

LADY MARY
I know you don't care about our silly rules. You're always very clear on that score.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
You make me sound rude, and I hope I'm not that. I mean to learn how to do things properly, and I'm sure you could help me a lot. But I'm not ashamed of being what they call a self-made man. I'm proud of it.

LADY MARY
Is the point of all this to test me in some way?

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
Maybe. Are you shocked by my bold and modern values?

LADY MARY
Oh, Sir Richard, you flatter yourself. It takes a good deal more than that to shock me.

--
[27:49, INT. THE DOWER HOUSE - DAY]

LADY ROSAMUND
But Mama, who do you imagine is out there with more to offer?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I am not a romantic.

LADY ROSAMUND
I should hope not.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
But even I will concede that the heart does not exist solely for the purpose of pumping blood

LADY ROSAMUND
That is charming. Especially from you. But Mary seems to have...blotted her copy book in some way.

[Rosamund waits, trying to gage her mother's reaction.]

LADY ROSAMUND
So she needs a suitable marriage that will mend her fences.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Well, how do we know Carlisle is suitable? I mean, who is he? Who'd ever heard of him before the war?

LADY ROSAMUND
Sir Richard is powerful and rich, and well on the way to appear rich. Of course, he may not be all that one would wish, but Mary can soon smooth off the rough edges.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Well, you should know.

LADY ROSAMUND
What do you mean by that? Marmaduke was a gentleman.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Marmaduke was the grandson of a manufacturer.

LADY ROSAMUND
His mother was the daughter of a baronet.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Maybe. But they were no great threat to the Plantagenets.

LADY ROSAMUND
The point is, I made up for any social deficiencies, and he provided me with a position. It was a good exchange, and it worked well.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
How can Matthew have chosen that little blonde piece?

LADY ROSAMUND
You speak so eloquently of the human heart, Mama. You must be aware of its...vagaries.

--
[29:07, INT. DOWNTON COTTAGE HOSPITAL - DAY]
[Thomas reads Lt. Courtenay's post to him.]

THOMAS
"Things cannot be as they were and, whatever you might think, Jack has your best interest at heart."

LT. COURTENAY
Stop.

THOMAS
Who's Jack?

LT. COURTENAY
My younger brother. He means to replace me. It's what he's always wanted.

THOMAS
Yeah, well...

LT. COURTENAY
I'm sorry. I mustn't bore you.

THOMAS
Don't let him walk all over you. Go fight your [?].

LT. COURTENAY
What with?

THOMAS
Your brain. You're not a victim, don't let them make you into one.

LT. COURTENAY
You know, when you talk like that, I almost believe you.

THOMAS
You should believe me. All my life they've pushed me around...just 'cause I'm different.

LT. COURTENAY
How? Why are you different?

THOMAS
Nevermind. Look. Look, I d-- I don't know if you're going to see again or not, but I do know you have to fight back.

[Courtenay pat's Thomas's knee in thanks. Thomas grasps his hand back.]

--
[30:42, EXT. DOWNTON ABBEY, GROUNDS - DAY]
[Rosamund pauses on her walk when she hears Lavinia.]

LAVINIA
How dare you threaten me.

[Carlisle has a hold on Lavinia's wrists.]

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
How dare I? Oh, I assure you, I dare a great deal more than that.

LAVINIA
You can't. You wouldn't.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
I didn't say I would. I was merely reminding you it was in my power.

[Rosamund lingers on her walk and Lavinia and Carlisle catch sight of her.]

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
Lady Painswick.

LADY ROSAMUND
Lady Rosamund.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
I'm sorry. I'll get these things sorted out before too long.

LADY ROSAMUND
It's not important.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
Miss Swire and I were just talking about old times.

LAVINIA
Happy old times, I hope. Will you forgive me? I want to write some letters before dinner.

--
[31:20, EXT. LONG FIELD FARM - DAY]
[Edith continues to help out on the farm.]

JOHN DRAKE
Let's have a rest. We've earned it.

[Drake fetches a couple of beers.]

JOHN DRAKE
I should've gone in for a glass. I don't suppose you can drink out of a bottle, can you milady?

LADY EDITH
I wish you'd call me Edith. And of course I can drink from the bottle.

[They drink.]

LADY EDITH
Would you like me to teach you to drive?

JOHN DRAKE
Not much. Then you wouldn't come here no more.

[Edith smiles.]

JOHN DRAKE
Although, that wouldn't matter to you.

LADY EDITH
Why do you say that?

JOHN DRAKE (sigh)
You're pretty and clever and fine. You're from a different world.

[Mrs Drake comes around the cart with a couple of pails and a sour expression.]

MRS DRAKE
Is something wrong?

JOHN DRAKE
No. Just having a break.

MRS DRAKE
Because you want to get into town to fetch the bone meal. And be back in time to feed the cows before it's dark.

LADY EDITH
They could always have a midnight feast.

[Drake and Edith laugh. Mrs Drake nods and glares at her husband.]

--
[32:19, EXT. DOWNTON COTTAGE HOSPITAL, EXERCISE YARD - DAY]
[Sybil and Thomas are teaching Lt. Courtenay how to walk with a cane.]

THOMAS
That's it. That's right, sir. If you move the stick fast enough, you don't have to slacken your pace.

LADY SYBIL
And check the width of the space as well as any possible obstruction.

DR CLARKSON
Lieutenant Courtenay!

[Clarkson approaches.]

DR CLARKSON
Well done. You're making good progress.

LT. COURTENAY
Thanks to my saviours.

[Sybil smiles and Thomas salutes the major.]

DR CLARKSON
So you'll be pleased to hear that we're all agreed that it's time for you to continue treatment elsewhere.

LT. COURTENAY
What?

DR CLARKSON
At Farley Hall. You're not ill anymore. All you need is time to adjust to your condition, and the staff at Farley can help with that.

LT. COURTENAY
But, sir, these two are helping me here.

DR CLARKSON
Nurse Crawley and Corporal Barrow are not trained in specialist care.

LT. COURTENAY
Please. Don't sent me away. Not yet.

THOMAS
Sir, surely we--

[Dr Crawley shoots Thomas a look.]

DR CLARKSON
Lieutenant, you must know that every one of our beds is needed for the injured and dying from Arras. Mm?

[Dr Clarkson pats Courtenay on the arm.]

DR CLARKSON
Corporal, I'll see you in my office.

--
[33:26, INT. DR CLARKSON'S OFFICE - DAY]

THOMAS
Sir, I only meant to say that Lieutenant Courtenay is depressed.

DR CLARKSON
I will not leave wounded soldiers freezing or sweating under canvas because one junior officer is depressed!

[A knock at the door.]

DR CLARKSON
Yes!

LADY SYBIL
I thought you may want to know what I think.

DR CLARKSON
Why should I? Nurse Crawley, I may not be your social superior in a Mayfair ballroom, but in this hospital, I have the deciding voice. Please help him prepare his belongings. He leaves first thing in the morning.

--
[33:55, INT. MR CARSON'S BEDROOM - EVENING]
[Mrs Hughes sits by Mr Carson's bed, giving him the household updates.]

MRS HUGHES
Anna and Ethel will wait at the table and I will supervise. What's wrong with that?

MR CARSON
Nothing. Except that it's how a charted accountant would have his dinner served.

MRS HUGHES
I can think of worse insults.

MR CARSON
If you say so. B--but I don't want Lang allowed anywhere near it. Oh, Mr Bates, where are you when we need you?

[Mrs Hughes stands.]

MR CARSON
Can you bring me the wine ledgers and I'll make a selection?

MRS HUGHES
His Lordship's already done that. Just try to rest.

MR CARSON
To rest? Or to feel redundant?

MRS HUGHES
Both, if it'll slow you down for a minute and a half. The world does not turn on the style of a dinner

MR CARSON
My world does.

--
[34:36, INT. LADY MARY'S BEDROOM - EVENING]

LADY ROSAMUND
How does he know Miss Swire?

LADY MARY
What?

LADY ROSAMUND
Miss Swire. They were in the garden when I came back from Mama's.

LADY MARY
I suppose they met in London.

[Anna enters.]

ANNA
Would you like me to come back later, milady?

LADY ROSAMUND
No, come in. I was just leaving.

LADY MARY
How's Carson getting on?

ANNA
Oh, much better, milady. Mrs Hughes is having a job keeping him in bed.

LADY MARY
He gave me some advice last night.

ANNA
Oh yes? Was it good advice?

LADY MARY
It was about honesty. He thinks I should say what I really feel.

ANNA
Sounds a bit wild for Mr Carson.

LADY MARY
Do you think he's right?

ANNA
Well, they do say honesty's the best policy, and I think you regret being honest less often than you regret telling lies.

--
[35:40, INT. DOWNTON COTTAGE HOSPITAL, WARD - NIGHT]
[We see a pool of blood on the floor, and a nurse rushes out of the ward. Lt. Courtenay has slit his wrists.]

[BREAK 2]

--
[35:57, INT. DOWNTON COTTAGE HOSPITAL, CORRIDOR - NIGHT]
[Thomas cries.]

--
[36:07, INT. DOWNTON COTTAGE HOSPITAL, EXERCISE YARD - DAY]

DR CLARKSON
He must've smuggled a razor into his bed. There was nothing to be done.

LADY SYBIL
It's because we ordered him to go.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
We don't know that.

DR CLARKSON
This is a tragedy, I don't deny it. But I cannot see what other course was open to me. He have no room for men to convalesce here and Farley is the nearest house I can send them to.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
There is a solution and it's staring us in the face. Downton Abbey.

DR CLARKSON (scoffs)
Would the ever allow it?

[A revelation occurs to Sybil and Clarkson.]

DR CLARKSON
Or even consider it?

LADY SYBIL
I think they would. After this, I think they can be made to.

--
[36:47, EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY]

LADY MARY
But Sir Richard, you don't have to

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
Richard. Please.

[Mary nods.]

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
You see, I want you to marry me.

LADY MARY
Why?

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
Because I think very highly of you.

LADY MARY
Very highly. Goodness.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
I mean it. I think we'd do well together. We could be a good team.

LADY MARY
Now that sounds better. But I can't help thinking that tradition demands a little mention of love.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
Oh, I can talk about love and moon and June and all the rest of it, if you wish, but we're more than that. We're strong and sharp, and we can build something worth having, you and I. If you'll let us.

LADY MARY
Your proposal is improving by leaps and bounds. You must give me some time, but I promise to think about it. Properly.

SIR RICHARD CARLISLE
I'm counting on it.

[He tips his hat to her and boards the train.]

--
[38:03, EXT/INT. DOWNTON COTTAGE HOSPITAL - DAY]
[Branson carries a basket to the hospital where wounded soldiers are piling out of hospital trucks. Sybil settles the wounded while Isobel directs them to their beds. Branson brings the basket to Sybil.]

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Right to the other end, that way.

BRANSON
Her Ladyship had Mrs Patmore make this up for you so you could eat something during the day.

LADY SYBIL
Oh, I won't have time.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Clarkson.

[Matthew nods to the doctor as he enters.]

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
Oh, Matthew. I'm afraid I'm very busy, as you can see.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I just want to help.

[Dr Clarkson points some stretcher bearers to a bed.]

DR CLARKSON
It's right over there.

[They move the man onto a bed and Matthew wanders aimlessly among the beds in shock.]

BRANSON
Is it what you thought it would be?

LADY SYBIL
No. No, it's more savage and more cruel than I could've imagined, but I feel useful for the first time in my life, and that must be a good thing. Matthew, are you busy?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
No, of course not.

[Matthew helps a man into bed.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Quite safe.

[Isobel continues directing the wounded.]

BRANSON
So you wouldn't go back? To your life before the war?

LADY SYBIL
No. No, I can never go back to that again.

[Sybil goes about her work and Branson watches her for a moment.]

--
[39:22, EXT. CRAWLEY HOUSE, GARDEN - DAY]
[Mary approaches the Crawley's house and finds Lavinia crying in the garden.]

LADY MARY
Lavinia? What's the matter?

LAVINIA
Are you looking for Matthew?

LADY MARY
I was. But it's not important.

[Mary sits down next to her.]

LADY MARY
Tell me what it is. Please.

LAVINIA
He has to go a day early. Tomorrow morning, in fact.

LADY MARY
Only to meet his general, surely? Not back to France.

LAVINIA
But he must go back one day. And I can't stop thinking about what I'd do if anything happened to him.

LADY MARY
I know he'll be all right.

LAVINIA
No you don't. None of us do. We say that sort of thing, but we don't know. If he died, I don't think I could go on living.

[Matthew approaches.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
What you doing?

LAVINIA
Excuse me.

[Lavinia walks past Matthew to the house.]

LADY MARY
Lavinia's a bit upset.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
She's awfully cut up that I have to go early, but it's only to Coventry, which doesn't sound too dangerous.

[Mary smiles.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
If you're looking for Mother, she's at the hospital. I've just come from there.

LADY MARY
Actually it's you I came to see.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Oh? How can I help?

LAVINIA
Mary, can you stay for luncheon?

LADY MARY
I can't. But thank you.

[Lavinia returns to the house.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
So, what was your mission?

LADY MARY
Just to say...

[Mary hesitates, but she can't say it.]

LADY MARY
We hope you're still coming for dinner tonight.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Certainly we are. Why wouldn't we?

LADY MARY
Sure? It'll be your last evening.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Why? Don't you want me?

LADY MARY
Of course I want you. Very much.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
I'm sorry you've had a wasted journey.

LADY MARY
Not at all. I needed an excuse for a walk. I'll see you at eight.

--
[41:49, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - DAY]

ANNA
Ethel said you wanted me.

MR MOLESLEY
No, no. I just needed a word with you.

ANNA
If it's about that book, I'm afraid--

MR MOLESLEY
No, no. It's not about the book.

ANNA
What is it then?

MR MOLESLEY
I understand that Mr Bates is gone. For good.

ANNA
Yes. I believe that's true.

MR MOLESLEY
So, I was hoping we might be able to see a little more of each other.

ANNA
Mr Molesley...I take this as a real compliment.

MR MOLESLEY
But it's not going to happen.

ANNA
No. You see...if you had a child and that child was taken from you. If--if the child was sent to the moon, there'd never be one day when they were out of your thoughts. Nor one moment when you weren't praying for their welfare, even if you knew you'd never see them again.

MR MOLESLEY
And that's you and Mr Bates.

ANNA
That's me and Mr Bates. But thank you.

[Molesley puts on a smile and Anna leaves.]

--
[43:07, EXT. LONG FIELD FARM - EVENING]
[Edith and Drake finish up some chores.]

JOHN DRAKE
I've kept you too long. You better get back or they'll come looking for you.

LADY EDITH
We've done a lot, haven't we?

JOHN DRAKE
We have. I'll be forced to invent some tasks. They'll be no need for you to come much more.

LADY EDITH
Then start inventing, please.

JOHN DRAKE
I will. 'Cause I'd hate it if you were to stay away.

LADY EDITH
So would I. I'd absolutely hate it.

[Edith and Drake kiss.]

JOHN DRAKE
I can't believe I've done that.

LADY EDITH
I'm awfully glad you did.

[Mrs Drake watches them.]

JOHN DRAKE
You'd have me thrown in the Tower.

LADY EDITH
Only if they give me the key.

--
[43:59, INT. KITCHENS - EVENING]

MRS PATMORE
Fold it in, don't slap it. You're making a cake, not beating a carpet.

[Robert walks in.]

MRS PATMORE
Oh. I'm sorry, Your Lordship. I didn't see you there.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
It's quite all right, Mrs Patmore. I wonder, is there somewhere we could have a word?

MRS PATMORE
Er, er...

MRS HUGHES
Why not go into my sitting room?

--
[44:18, INT. MRS HUGHES'S SITTING ROOM - EVENING]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Please sit.

[He closes the door and they sit.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I do have some news of your nephew. I telephoned the war office and they've just come back to me, but I'm afraid it's not good news.

MRS PATMORE
I--I knew he was dead all along. I-- I said so to my sister. I said, "Kate", I said, "He's gone and you'll have to face-- "

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Mrs Patmore, it's worse than that.

MRS PATMORE
What can be worse than being dead?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Private Philpots was shot for cowardice on the 17th of February.

MRS PATMORE
Oh my God.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
This explains why the regiment was reluctant to supply information.

[Robert stands up and opens the door while Mrs Patmore begins to cry.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Mrs Hughes, could you come in, please?

[Mrs Hughes enters and Robert closes the door.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Mrs Patmore has had some bad news. Her nephew has been killed.

MRS HUGHES
Oh, he never has.

MRS PATMORE
And that's not all.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
It is all. Mrs Patmore.

[Mrs Hughes takes Mrs Patmore's hand.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Let us make sure it is all. Your sister needs to know no more than this. We cannot know the truth. We should not judge.

[Robert nods to Mrs Hughes]

--
[45:36, INT. DRAWING ROOM - EVENING]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I think it's a ridiculous idea!

LADY SYBIL
Why?

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Because this is a house, not a hospital.

LADY MARY
But, Granny, a convalescent home is where people rest and recuperate.

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
But if there are relapses? What then? Amputation in the dining room? Resuscitation in the pantry?

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
It would certainly be the most tremendous disturbance. If you knew how chaotic things are as it is.

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
But when there's so much good can be done.

[Violet slams her cane on the floor.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I forbid it. To have strange men prodding and prying around the house, to say nothing of pocketing the spoons. It's out of the question.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
I hesitate to remind you, but this is my house now. Robert's and mine, and we will make the decision.

[Cora gets up and takes a drink from Mrs Hughes.]

VIOLET, DOWAGER COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Oh, I see. So now I'm an outsider...who need not be consulted.

CORA, COUNTESS OF GRANTHAM
Since you put it like that, yes.

--
[46:33, INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
What was it like at the hospital today?

[Matthew looks haunted.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
At the front...the men pray to be spared, of course...but if that's not to be...they pray for a bullet that kills them cleanly. For too many of them today, that prayer had not been answered.

--
[47:07, INT. KITCHENS - EVENING]

MRS PATMORE
Er, we'll eat in about twenty minutes.

WILLIAM
Good. Would you have any to spare for a poor traveller?

[William does a marching stop in his uniform.]

DAISY
William, I don't believe it.

WILLIAM
Pinch me. I am your dream come true.

DAISY
You're like a real soldier.

WILLIAM
I am a real soldier, thank you very much. Now come and give me a kiss.

MRS PATMORE
Ooh, we'll have none of that.

[Daisy rushes to hug him.]

WILLIAM
Won't you let a Tommy kiss his sweetheart, Mrs Patmore when he's off to fight the Hun?

DAISY
Have you finished your training?

WILLIAM
Not yet, but it won't be long now.

MRS PATMORE
Well, on the eve of departure, we'll see, but right now, put her down.

WILLIAM
So...

[William stands at attention.]

WILLIAM
What do you think?

[Daisy brushes his uniform with her fingers.]

WILLIAM
Smart, ain't it?

[Mrs Patmore heaves a sigh, thinking of her nephew.]

--
[47:46, INT. SERVANTS' HALL - EVENING]
[Lang reads at the table. William walks in.]

ANNA
William? What a treat to see you. And how smart you look. Welcome.

WILLIAM
Thanks.

ANNA
Supper won't be long. I'm just going up to clear the dining room.

WILLIAM
Shall I help?

ANNA
Of course not. You're in the army now.

[She smiles at him and leaves.]

MR LANG
So, still full of the joys of warfare?

WILLIAM
I'm not sorry to be part of it, Mr Lang, and I can't pretend I am.

MR LANG
Oh, yes, you're part of it. Like a metal cog is part of a factory, or a grain of sand is part of the beach.

WILLIAM
It's all right, Mr Lang. I understand. And I'm not saying I'm important, or ought like that. But I believe in this war. I believe in what we're fighting for and I want to do my bit. 

MR LANG
Then God help you.

[BREAK 3]

--
[48:43, INT. DRAWING ROOM - EVENING]
[Edith talks with Lavinia, Isobel speaks with Robert and Cora, and Matthew talks with Mary.]

EDITH
Today I drove the tractor...

ISOBEL CRAWLEY
More serious than her [?], surely not.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
I think it's given us all..

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Edith seems jolly tonight.

LADY MARY
She's found her metier. Farm labouring.

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Don't be so tough on her.

LADY MARY
That's like asking the fox to spare the chicken

[Matthew chuckles.]

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
What about you? Last time, you told me good news was imminent.

LADY MARY
Would you be happy if it were?

MATTHEW CRAWLEY
Of course. I've found someone now. And I want you to do the same.

[Mary smiles politely.]

[49:13, INT. KITCHENS - EVENING]

WILLIAM
"If you had taken another minute to make up your mind, sir, we'd all have marched over the cliff."

[The servants laugh at William's tale.]

WILLIAM
And I'll tell you something else as well--

[Daisy walks up to Mrs Patmore.]

MRS PATMORE
William's got more to say than a [?] candidate.

[Daisy stands there nervously, bursting to say something.]

MRS PATMORE
What's the matter?

DAISY
I know it's my fault, but I wish I hadn't let him think that we're, like, sweethearts. Because we're not. Not by my reckoning, anyway.

MRS PATMORE
Huh. Too late for second thoughts now, missy. Now, you don't have to marry him when it comes to it, but you can't let him go to war with a broken heart or he won't come back.

[49:50, INT. LADY MARY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT]

LADY MARY
What a time we've had. Poor Sir Richard must've thought he'd come to a madhouse.

ANNA
I don't expect it'll put him off.

LADY MARY
I'm going to accept him. Do you think I should?

ANNA
That's not for me to say. If you love him more than anyone in the world, then of course you should.

LADY MARY
It's not as simple as that.

ANNA
Oh? It is for me. But then, I'm not Your Ladyship.

LADY MARY
Did you love Bates more than anyone else in the world?

ANNA
I did. I do. I'll never love again like I love him. Never.

LADY MARY
Well, there you are then. One day you'll meet someone else and you'll marry. Perhaps it'll second best, but it doesn't mean you can't have a life.

ANNA
I think it does. For me.

[51:13, INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING]
[Carson serves the family breakfast.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Are you sure you should be doing this, Carson? We've managed very well with Mrs Hughes.

MR CARSON
Quite sure, my lord. And breakfast is not a taxing assignment.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Edith, this is a message for you. Mrs Drake writes that they've decided to hire a man, so they won't be needing you anymore.

[Edith is stunned.]

LADY EDITH
Is that all she says?

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Oh, well, she's very grateful...Here we are. She says "[She and Drake] send their thanks to you for giving up so much of your valuable time." I expect it's rather a relief.

LADY EDITH
Oh, I wouldn't say that. Not entirely.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Has Lady Sybil gone already?

MR CARSON
She had a half past six.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
She would.

[Edith is still trying to process the blow.]

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Carson, have they told you we're to be turned into a hospital?

LADY MARY
A convalescent home. I'm afraid we've all bullied you into the whole thing. I hope you're not dreading it too much.

ROBERT, EARL OF GRANTHAM
Not dreading it, exactly, but it's a brave new world we're headed for, no doubt about that. We must try to meet it with as much grace as we can muster.

[Robert opens the rest of his post. Edith is still reeling.]
